There\n   are dozens of HGP-like projects which involve from a few tens to several million genomes currently in progress, which vary from\n   having specialized goals or a more general approach. However, data generation, storage, management and analysis in public and\n   private cloud computing platforms have raised concerns about privacy and security. The knowledge gained from further research\n   has changed the ﬁeld of genomics and is now slowly permeating into clinical medicine. The new precision (personalized) medicine,\n   where genome sequencing and data analysis are essential components, allows tailored diagnosis and treatment according to the\n   information from the patient’s own genome and speciﬁc environmental factors. P4 (predictive, preventive, personalized and\n   participatory) medicine is introducing new concepts, challenges and opportunities. This review summarizes current sequencing\n   technologies, concentrates on ongoing human genomics projects, and provides some examples in which precision medicine has\n   already demonstrated clinical impact in diagnosis and/or treatment.\n\n   Gene Therapy (2017) 24, 551–561; doi:10.1038/gt.2017.77\n\n\n\n\nINTRODUCTION                                                                        be handled securely and interpreted knowledgeably and\nThe completion of the Human Genome Project (HGP) has been                           thoroughly.\ncompared to the ﬁrst human moon landing.

On January 2016 the Chinese       researchers, clinicians, industry partners, regulators and, of course,\nAcademy of Sciences (CAS) announced the Chinese Precision              groups of patients and families.58 The two main goals by 2020 are\nMedicine Initiative (CPMI), which will have received government        to develop diagnostic tests for the majority of rare diseases (6000)\nfunding of $9.2 billion by 2030.45 The Chinese government has          and to ﬁnd 200 new treatments for them. To achieve these goals\nconﬁrmed that precision medicine will be part of its Five Year Plan    IRDiRC are performing a molecular characterization of rare\nfor 2016–2020. Ofﬁcial announcements of the plan were made             diseases (for which NGS is an invaluable tool) and setting up\nduring the National People's Congress.46 This project will be led by   well-coordinated access to samples and data. So far, more than\nthe BGI which will manage the research work from several               3600 genetic tests are available and the number of new drugs\ninstitutes collecting genetic information from 4000 volunteers in      since 2010 is well over 200.59 IRDiRC has also conceived the\nthe ﬁrst four years.
