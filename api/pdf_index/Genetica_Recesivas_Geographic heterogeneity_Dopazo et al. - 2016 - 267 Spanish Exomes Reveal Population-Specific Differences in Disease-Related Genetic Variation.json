The need for a detailed catalog of local variability motivated\nthe whole-exome sequencing of 267 unrelated individuals, representative of the healthy Spanish population. Like in other\nstudies, a considerable number of rare variants were found (almost one-third of the described variants). There were also\nrelevant differences in allelic frequencies in polymorphic variants, including \u000210,000 polymorphisms private to the\nSpanish population. The allelic frequencies of variants conferring susceptibility to complex diseases (including cancer,\nschizophrenia, Alzheimer disease, type 2 diabetes, and other pathologies) were overall similar to those of other popu-\nlations. However, the trend is the opposite for variants linked to Mendelian and rare diseases (including several retinal\ndegenerative dystrophies and cardiomyopathies) that show marked frequency differences between populations.\nInterestingly, a correspondence between differences in allelic frequencies and disease prevalence was found, highlighting\nthe relevance of frequency differences in disease risk. These differences are also observed in variants that disrupt known\ndrug binding sites, suggesting an important role for local variability in population-specific drug resistances or adverse\neffects. We have made the Spanish population variant server web page that contains population frequency information\nfor the complete list of 170,888 variant positions we found publicly available (http://spv.babelomics.org/), We show that\nit if fundamental to determine population-specific variant frequencies to distinguish real disease associations from\npopulation-specific polymorphisms.\nKey words: population variability, exome sequencing, disease variants, pharmacogenomic variants.\n\n\n\nß The Author 2016.
