Gupta and V. K. Verma\n\n\n15.1     \u0007Introduction and History of Sequencing\n\nEarlier, Sanger’s method of DNA sequencing was the only easy and popular method\nto determine the sequence of DNA molecule. On top of everything, this dideoxy\nchain termination method was diligently used for more than three decades from its\ndiscovery. Since the start of the twenty-first century, high-throughput sequencing\ntechnology has made an impact on the genomics research because it enabled\ngenome-wide sequencing and screening far easier, inexpensive, and reproducible\nwith lesser need of manpower (Metzker 2010). Using NGS, the genome of the bac-\nteria can be sequenced in a single run. Sequencing of the DNA allows us to provide\nthe basic information, i.e., the sequence/order of the nucleotides. After recognizing\nthat this could be a magic tool to understand the gene sequences and location of the\ngene regulatory molecules, a UK-based team led by Dr. Frederick Sanger initiated\nwork on DNA sequencing in 1972. He finally developed the “dideoxy chain termi-\nnation” method for DNA sequencing and also published his work in 1977 (Sanger\net al. 1977a). The method was based upon the base-specific termination of the grow-\ning chain. DNA polymerase adds the nucleotides on the chain, but upon the incor-\nporation of dideoxynucleotide, the chain terminates due to its inability of the\nphosphodiester bond formation between newly coming nucleotide and dideoxynu-\ncleotide. In the same year 1977, a US team led by Maxam and Gilbert also pub-\nlished a chemical-based sequencing method in which the sequencing of DNA was\ndependent on chemical cleavage protocol (Maxam and Gilbert 1977). This method\nwas based upon the use of harmful chemicals such as dimethyl sulfate (DMS) and\nhydrazine and hence was not that popular among molecular biologists. In contrast,\nthe Sanger’s method was accepted widely because of its easy protocol and use of\nlesser harmful reagents (Obenrader 2003). However, both Fredrick Sanger and\nWalter Gilbert were awarded with the Nobel Prize in chemistry in 1980 for their\nDNA sequencing method discovery. Using Sanger’s method, bacteriophage ΦX174\ngenome of 5386 bp was sequenced, and it was the beginning of the full DNA\ngenome sequencing (Sanger et al. 1977b).\n    Sanger’s method was the method of choice and used for the genome sequencing\nof a number of organisms. Haemophilus influenzae was the first bacterium of\ngenome size 1,830,140 bp sequenced using an approach, namely, shotgun, in 1995\n(Fleischmann et al. 1995). Soon after this, Saccharomyces cerevisiae was the first\neukaryotic genome of size 12,156,677 bp sequenced in 1996 (Goffeau et al. 1996).\nMajor breakthrough happened when human genome (14.8 billion bp) was sequenced\nand got published in 2001. The human genome was sequenced using two different\napproaches by two different independent teams. Using shotgun approach (where the\ngenome got fragmented randomly), Dr. Craig Venter’s team from a company called\nCelera Genomics published its dataset in 2001 (Venter et al. 2001), whereas Francis\nCollins group from the National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI, NIH)\nused the BAC contigs (bactigs) approach for the mapping of sequence.\n    The major limitation of the Sanger’s method was that it could sequence very less\nnumber of DNA sequences in one go and also the cost per base was very high.\nApparently, the high rise in the complex diseases and their relation with the\n\f15   Next-Generation Sequencing and Its Application: Empowering in Public Health…         315\n\n\n\n\nFig. 15.1 Sequencing events, developments, and introduction of different generations’ sequenc-\ning platforms in chronological order\n\nmutations/changes in the genome demand a far-flung knowledge of the genome\nsequence. Thus, it is required to sequence the genome of huge number of individu-\nals as well as other organisms for the diagnosis and treatment in short period of time\nwith low cost. This prompted the need of high-throughput sequencing technologies,\nwhich can provide information at substantially lower cost. Further, the development\nof high-throughput next-generation sequencing technology has proven that it can\ngenerate enormous data (millions of sequences) cost effectively and rapidly.\n   Here we have shown a timeline of sequencing events and introduction of plat-\nforms of different generations’ sequencing technologies (Fig. 15.1).\n\n\n15.2      \u0007Different Generations of Sequencing\n\nIt is very prominent that for almost four decades, the Sanger’s method was consid-\nered the gold standard because there was not a considerable development in DNA\nsequencing techniques in those years. In the last almost 15 years (from 2005), there\nare massive changes in the generation of sequencing technology. In short, changes\nin generation means the change in chemistry and platform. The widely accepted\nmethod of sequencing, i.e., Sanger’s method of DNA sequencing, covered the first-­\ngeneration sequencing along with Maxam-Gilbert method. Both methods were\ncapable of sequencing about 1 kilobase length DNA fragment at one shot. In the\nprocess of analyzing longer sequences, researchers used the “shotgun technique”\n\f316                                                             N. Gupta and V. K. Verma\n\nwhere overlapping sequences were cloned and sequenced separately followed by\nassembly into contigs (Anderson 1981). Sanger’s method is one of the best methods\nfor years to come for the sequencing of gene cloned in heterologous system because\nof its precision, robustness, and ease of use.\n    Scientists presented a next-generation sequencing technology, which comes\nunder second-generation sequencing technology that includes Roche 454, Illumina\nSolexa, and ABI-SOLiD and has transformed the field of omics. This technology\nwas able to produce enormous amount of data at very economic cost and expedi-\ntiously. Moreover, this technology is very rapid than traditional method that whole\ngenome of small organisms can be sequenced in a single day. However, in recent\nyears, Illumina platforms have contributed very much to the second-generation\nsequencers and hence are considered to be one of the best platform providers.\n    The third-generation sequencing that is also known as next next-generation\nsequencing refers to those technologies which do not depend on the PCR amplifica-\ntion of DNA molecule. Thus, the problem related to biasness through PCR amplifi-\ncation and dephasing was ruled out. Platforms of this generation, which include\nHelicos and PacBio, are capable of sequencing single molecule.\n    There is a platform called Ion Torrent that has been kept between second and\nthird generation because it is based upon first “post light sequencing” technology.\nThis does not require fluorescence or luminescence. Nanopore sequencers offered\nby Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT), namely, GridION and MinION, lie\nunder fourth generation. These platforms are based on different chemistry from\nthird-generation sequencers.\n    Note that Roche 454 platform was commercially introduced first, but nowadays\nit is not available in the market. This shows that the changes made in this field in the\npast 12–15 years are very rapid.\n\n\n15.3     \u0007 omparison of First-Generation and Second-­\n         C\n         Generation Sequencing Principle\n\nFirst generation includes two separate methods, namely, Sanger and Maxam Gilbert\nmethod. Both methods were equally accepted in the beginning, but Sanger’s method\nwas extensively used for the routine sequencing purposes, which was based on the\nchain termination method. In the chain termination method, upon incorporation of\nthe dideoxynucleotides (ddNTPs), the growing chain terminates. Fragments of var-\nied length (length varied by single nucleotide) of the DNA molecule then run on the\ntraditional slab gels and pattern of bands obtained for the sequence determination.\nSubsequently, radiolabeling is replaced with fluorescently labeled (automated\nmethod of sequencing) ddNTPs, and the laser light at different wavelengths does the\nsequence determination (Smith et al. 1986). This method can generate a maximum\nread length that ranges from 800 to 1000 bp. In this method, only one fragment can\nbe sequenced in one capillary, which means the output of one run is the length of the\nsequenced fragment.\n\f15   Next-Generation Sequencing and Its Application: Empowering in Public Health…   317\n\n    Conversely, the principle of second-generation sequencers or next-generation\nsequencers is based on clonal amplification of DNA molecule where billions of dif-\nferent DNA fragments get sequenced at the same time in parallel fashion and gener-\nate enormous data. For sequencing of the whole genome of an organism, random\nfragmentation is done at particular size range and then fragments ligated to the oli-\ngonucleotide adaptors, which are platform specific, followed by independent paral-\nlel sequencing. Parallel analysis increases the sequencing speed. NGS offers the\ncapability to produce massive volume of data from a single run at a very low cost in\na very short duration without the need of fragment cloning strategy, which is gener-\nally used in conventional method. As we can see, there is a vast difference in the cost\nper genome sequencing in 2001 ($100M) as compared to the cost in 2017 (<$1K)\n(data from NHGRI genome sequencing program). Complete draft sequence of the\nhuman genome with the help of automated Sanger’s method was published in 2001,\nwhich was the outcome of 13 years of rigorous efforts of international project of\n$2.7 billion. On the contrary, using NGS platform, the whole human genome can be\nsequenced in a week for a few thousand dollars (Gullapalli et al. 2012).\n\n\n15.4     \u0007Second-Generation/Next-Generation Sequencing\n          Technologies\n\nNGS and high-throughput sequencing generally denote to technologies that permit\nthe millions of sequencing reactions in parallel on the same solid surface which may\nbe beads or glass slide. This does not require the physical separation of reaction in\ndifferent well or in lane/tube but spatially separated. Hence, thousands of million\ndifferent reactions ensue simultaneously, because of which there is a dramatic\ndecrease in the labor input as compared to other conventional methods and the huge\nreduction in cost per se. The path involves several commercial NGS platforms that\nare based on different technologies but typically follow a general pattern or steps.\nGeneral steps involved in the DNA sequencing using NGS are (i) library prepara-\ntion (random fragmentation of genome, ligation with appropriate adaptors), (ii)\namplification of library, and (iii) sequencing using different approaches. The basic\nsteps involved are presented in a flowchart in Fig. 15.2. The generated results differ\nwith respect to read length, quality of the data, and quantity of the data based upon\nthe platform used. Classification of different sequencing technologies based upon\nthe type of technology, chemistry, detection system used, and method of amplifica-\ntion used in different generations of sequencing platforms is described in Fig. 15.3.\nHere in the following section, we will discuss about the current sequencing tech-\nnologies, their principle, and their advantages and limitation.\n\n\n15.4.1 \u0007Pyrosequencing Technology\n\nNyren’s group pioneered this sequencing by synthesis (SBS) approach technology in\n1993, where DNA sequencing is based upon detection of released pyrophosphate\n\f318                                                                    N. Gupta and V. K. Verma\n\n\n\n\nFig. 15.2 Schematic representation of the basic steps involved in DNA sequencing using different\nNGS platforms\n\n\n\n\nFig. 15.3 Classification of the next generation sequencing (NGS) on the basis of types of technol-\nogy, chemistry, detection system and clonal application\n\n(PPi) molecule during addition of nucleotide by DNA polymerase (Ronaghi et al.\n1996). The speed of the reaction is very fast as it just takes 3–4 s at room temperature\nto complete the reaction from addition of nucleotide to chemiluminescent detection.\nLater, 454 Life Sciences (a USA-based biotechnology company which was later\nacquired by Roche) took over this technology and commercialized it with some\n\f15   Next-Generation Sequencing and Its Application: Empowering in Public Health…   319\n\nmodifications. Pyrosequencing uses the enzyme luciferase from Photinus pyralis\n(American firefly) and recombinant ATP sulfurylase from Saccharomyces cerevisiae\n(Karamohamed et al. 1999). Two different approaches are available in pyrosequenc-\ning: (i) solid phase (Ronaghi et al. 1996) where DNA gets immobilized (based on\nthree-enzyme cascade method with washing step) and (ii) liquid phase (Ronaghi\net al. 1998) in which a nucleotide-degrading enzyme, pyrase, has been added (based\non four-enzyme cascade method without washing step) which excludes the require-\nment of solid support because of which reaction can be performed in a single tube.\n\n\n15.4.2 \u0007Roche 454 (GS FLX plus)\n\nIn 2007, 454 Life Sciences, a pyrosequencing technology-based sequencer, was\ntaken over by Roche and later known as Roche 454. Steps involved in pyrosequenc-\ning are fragmentation of the nucleic acid to be sequenced followed by synthesis of\ntemplate strand with the assistance of polymerase enzyme. On incorporation of new\nnucleotide by polymerase, the pyrophosphate molecule is released. This pyrophos-\nphate molecule converts the ADP to ATP in the presence of the enzyme ATP sulfury-\nlase. ATP molecule supplies the energy for the oxidation of luciferin, which\nsubsequently emits light and recorded by charge-coupled device (CCD). The identity\nof nucleotides added (all four dNTPs added in the reaction separately) into the reac-\ntion for polymerization is known to help in the determination of template sequence.\n    Pyrosequencing-based platform uses a massively parallel system for sequencing\nin picolitre volumes in microfluidic format. In brief, the methodology of sequencing\nis the fragmentation of DNA (~800 bp) using spray method (nebulizer), adaptors\nligation to the fragmented DNA, library preparation followed by attachment of\nlibrary to beads (DNA capture beads, which allows attachment of one fragment per\nbead). The beads make individual compartments, which are usually referred to as\nmicroreactors/microvesicles. Clonal amplification takes place in those compartments\nby emulsion PCR; subsequently, emulsion gets broken and beads attached clonally\namplified DNA becomes enriched in microreacters/microvesicles (Margulies et al.\n2005). All clonally amplified DNA-bound beads are individually loaded on picotitre\nplate (PTP; imprinted on the fiber-optic slide), which contains approx. 3.4 × 109\nwells of ~55 μm in depth and 75 picolitre calculated size. The slide/plate comprising\nthe picolitre-sized wells mounted in a flow cell, which forms the channel for the flow\nof the sequencing reagents above the wells. The base of the plate is connected with\nthe imaging device called as CCD that captures the emitted light and provides the\nresults in the form of flowgrams. Genome sequencer GS FLX produces nearly\n450 MB data from a single run whereas new genome sequencer (GS FLX plus) can\nproduce 700 MB data from a single run in ~10 h with an approximate cost of 5K to\n7K USD.\n\nAdvantage This is a fast (700 MB data in a day), accurate (~99.9% after filter) and\nreliable technology for high throughput real-time sequencing. The Roche 454 is an\nupgraded platform, which can give read length>700 bp. Further, the technology\n\f320                                                            N. Gupta and V. K. Verma\n\ndoes not require labeled nucleotides and primers followed by gel electrophoresis\nand suitable for de novo sequencing as well as confirmatory sequencing (Ronaghi\n2001). The technology provides flexibility in primer designing since it starts\nsequencing immediately downstream of primer sequence without keeping gap of\n30–40 bp.\n\nLimitation The platform sure has some limitation. The main constraint is the prob-\nlem in sequencing same nucleotide repeat (>8 bp), that is, homopolymer sequencing\n(Mardis 2008). Another, it is relatively costlier than other NGS technologies.\n\n\n15.5     \u0007Reversible Terminator Technology\n\nThis technology also depends on the sequencing by synthesis (SBS) strategy. Dr.\nJingyueJu was the first person who described reversible terminator sequencing tech-\nnology (Li et al. 2003). The basic difference between traditional sequencing and this\nis that the traditional sequencing uses ddNTPs to irreversibly terminate the exten-\nsion of the primer whereas reversible sequencing technology employs modified\nanalogue of nucleotide to terminate the extension of primer reversibly (Guo et al.\n2010). In the past decade, numerous reversible terminators have identified based\nupon reversible blocking groups and can be categorized into two types. One cate-\ngory belongs to 3’-O-blocked reversible terminators and other is 3’ unblocked\nreversible terminator. Illumina Solexa commercializes this technology because of\nits comprehensive acceptance in second-generation sequencers (Bentley et al.\n2008).\n\n\n15.5.1 \u0007Illumina Solexa\n\nAs stated above, this is the popular NGS platform of second generation. David\nKlenerman and Shankar Balasubramanian gave the idea for only one DNA mole-\ncule sequencing attached to microsphere with the foundation of Solexa in 1998. The\n“Solexa Genome Analyzer” system, which came in 2006 and later, it was acquired\nby Illumina for the sequencing of clonally amplified DNA (Voelkerding et al. 2009).\n    A flow cell, which is used by Illumina Solexa, is made up of optical transparent\nslide having eight lanes on its surface. Oligonucleotide anchors are immobilized to\nthe surface of the flow cell. In brief, the methodology of the sequencing is the frag-\nmentation of template DNA, end repairing of fragments (blunting and 5’ end phos-\nphorylation). Adenylation of 3’ ends by the addition of single ‘A’ nucleotide to\nfacilitate ligation with the oligonucleotide adapters carrying a ‘T’ overhang at 3’.\nSince ligated adapters are complementary to the flow cell, anchors thus get hybrid-\nized. The DNA template attached to the anchors of the flow cell relies for the cluster\ngeneration by “bridge amplification” in contrast to emulsion PCR (Adessi et al.\n2000). Further, DNA fragment makes an arc and hybridizes with its distal end to\nneighboring anchor oligonucleotide to its complementary part. Because of clonal\n\f15   Next-Generation Sequencing and Its Application: Empowering in Public Health…   321\n\namplification, each template generates thousands of copies (clusters) of same tem-\nplate DNA and subsequently millions of separate (unique) clusters are generated on\nthe single flow cell followed by addition of DNA polymerase, and four different\nfluorescent-labeled reversible terminators aid in sequencing the millions of clusters\nin parallel fashion onto the flow cell. Polymerization terminates because of the\nincorporation of fluorescent-labeled reversible terminators (ddNTPs) and incorpo-\nrated nucleotide is identified by the fluorescence captured (Guo et al. 2008). By the\nenzymatic cleavage, the fluorescence label gets cleaved, which permits the incorpo-\nration of next nucleotide (www.illumina.com). Recently, several technical improve-\nments are happening rapidly in this sequencing technology including library\npreparation method, which involves fragmentation of the DNA in acceptable sizes\nby Covaris (Adaptive Focused Acoustic wave) sonication method and improved\nadapter ligation efficiency, etc.\n    Illumina platforms dominate in high throughput sequencing market. Currently,\nIllumina is producing a series of platforms (MiSeq, HiSeq series and NextSeq series).\nDifferent platforms are augmented for throughput and turnaround time of the run.\nMost recognized platforms are MiSeq and series of HiSeq platforms. The MiSeq is a\npersonal tabletop sequencer marketed in 2011, where a run can be completed in as\nfast as in four hours for the targeted bacterial sequencing. On the contrary, HiSeq\n2500 is applicable for high throughput sequencing like 1 TB data from a single run\nin 5–6 days. New model of HiSeq platform, that is, HiSeq 2500, can also be run in\nfast mode. However, run will not be cost effective and will sequence 30X human\ngenome in approximately 27 h. In the beginning of 2014, Illumina launched another\ntwo NextSeq 500 and HiSeq X Ten. NextSeq 500 is similar to MiSeq made for indi-\nvidual labs. HiSeq X Ten platform works as whole genome sequencer at population\nscale. Presently, Illumina only supports sample of human for whole genome sequenc-\ning on HiSeq X Ten. MiniSeq platform from Illumina also came into the market in\n2016. Most recently released platforms from Illumina are HiSeq 3000 and HiSeq\n4000 based on the patterned flow cell technology. Their data output and run time lie\nbetween HiSeq X Ten and HiSeq 2500 (Reuter et al. 2015).\n    The latest machine from Illumina launched at the end of 2017 is HiSeq 100. This\nis the smallest and most inexpensive sequencer in the portfolio of Illumina with a\nmaximum data output of 1.2 GB and 4 million reads per run, with run time ranging\nfrom 9 to 17.5 h (www.illumina.com/iseq).\n\nAdvantage First and foremost, the technology provides high throughput data in a\nvery short period of time with very low amount of sample per run (Buermans and\nden Dunnen 2014). The newer platforms of Illumina like HiSeq 2500, HiSeq 2000\nand MiSeq generate more data (up to 600 GB) at low cost per base. Using the plat-\nform based on reversible terminator technology, 1 TB data can be generated in a\nsingle day. Another big advantage is the longer read lengths, that is, 300 bp paired-­\nend sequencing in Illumina (MiSeq) platform is now possible, which was earlier\n25 bp single-end reads by Solexa. Besides this, Illumina platforms provide 99.9%\naccuracy of the sequencing data (Morey et al. 2013). Because of the presence of\n\f322                                                               N. Gupta and V. K. Verma\n\nblocking group, the addition of only one nucleotide per cycle facilitates the sequenc-\ning of homopolymeric regions efficiently (Mardis 2013).\n\nLimitation Major limitation is guanine and cytosine (GC) biasness, which gets\nintroduced during bridge amplification (Mardis 2013). Another concern is dephas-\ning, which means the different copies of DNA in a cluster get out of sync (inconsis-\ntent). In other words, inappropriate deblocking of nucleotide results in varying\nlength fragments in a cluster. This decreases the accuracy in base calling at 3’ end\nof the DNA fragments, especially in invert repeat sequence (Nakamura et al. 2011).\n\n\n15.5.2 \u0007Sequencing by Ligation Technology\n\nThis is a DNA sequencing technique, which determines the DNA sequence by uti-\nlizing the mismatch sensitivity of DNA ligase enzyme (Ho et al. 2011). Applied\nBiosystems, USA marketed this technology in 2008. The platforms of this technol-\nogy rely upon oligonucleotide probes of variable lengths, labeled with different\nfluorescence tag liable to the nucleotide to be sequenced.\n\n\n15.5.3 \u0007ABI-SOLiD\n\nThe expansion of SOLiD is small oligonucleotide ligation and detection system. The\ntechnology was invented in 2005 by George Church. Later in 2008, it was further\nupgraded and marketed by Applied Biosystems (Voelkerding et al. 2009), which is\nnow acquired by Life Technologies. The sequencing reaction can be divided into five\nbroad steps: (1) preparation of DNA library (2) clonal amplification in microreactors\nby emulsion PCR (3) attachment of the beads (4) sequencing and (5) resetting of\nprimer. In brief, the methodology for sequencing using this technology includes frag-\nmentation of DNA, attachment of fragments to the beads and clonal amplification of\nfragments attached to the beads by emulsion PCR. Following this, adapter sequences\nin amplified fragments hybridized to the specific primers. This facilitates the ligation\nof octamer (eight base pair) interrogation probe (fluorescently labeled) by offering 5’\n-PO4 group in place of 3’ –OH group. The first two bases of interrogation probes are\nspecific while the other six are degenerate. Set of four different fluorescent-tagged\nprobes (interrogation probe), having one out of sixteen possible combinations (e.g.,\nAC, AT, AC, AG, CG, TC, GT and TT) of two base (specific) at the end compete to\nligate with the primer. After ligation, fluorescence is imaged that is equivalent to the\ninterrogation probe ligated. For another round of cycle, 5’ –PO4 group regenerated\nby the deletion of fluorescence label of the attached interrogation probe. Further,\nsteps of the previous cycle are repeated after injection of set of four different fluores-\ncent-tagged probes. Generally after seven cycles of ligation, template is reset to the\nn-1 position of complementary primer for another round of ligation. This procedure\nis repeated every time with a consecutive offset like n-1, n-2 and so on of a new\nprimer. A single run on SOLiD 5500 platform takes approx. 6–7 days to complete\n\f15   Next-Generation Sequencing and Its Application: Empowering in Public Health…   323\n\nand produce 120–240 GB data with 75 bases read length while SOLiD 4 platform\ngenerates 100 GB data.\n\nAdvantage This technology offers the highest accuracy of ~99.99% (Voelkerding\net al. 2009) because each nucleotide sequenced two times, thus, there is pretty less\nchances of miscall from two contiguous colors.\n\nLimitation One of the limitations is time taken in one run is so long (6–7 days)\nalong with production of less data as compared to Illumina platforms. Another limi-\ntation is that if we compare with other second-generation methods (sequencing by\nsynthesis), the analysis of the data is complex in this technology, which impedes the\nmarketing of the platform. De novo sequencing is another limitation in using this\ntechnology.\n\n\n15.6     \u0007Third-Generation Sequencing Technologies\n\nSecond-generation technology platforms were the most widely used platforms. But\nthe major limitation of them was the occurrence of biasness because of PCR ampli-\nfication step. On the contrary, third-generation sequencing technologies do not\nrequire amplification step and are capable of sequencing single DNA molecule in\nreal time. These platforms have the capability to provide single run at very low cost\nas well as made the preparation of sample easier. Further, third-generation platforms\nproduce generally longer read of about some kilobase length, which resolve the\nproblem of assembling the reads.\n   Dr. Stephen Quake’s team established the first single-molecule sequencing tech-\nnology (SMT) (Braslavsky et al. 2003), which was further commercialized by\nHelicos Biosciences.\n\n\n15.6.1 \u0007Single-Molecule Real-Time Sequencing\n\nNanofluidics Incorporation pioneered single-molecule real-time sequencing\n(SMRT). This technology for sequencing is based upon two key inventions: phos-\npholinked nucleotides and zero-mode waveguides (ZMW). The key feature of\nZMW is that it only permits light to illuminate the bottom of a well where the\nimmobilized template and DNA polymerase are present.\n\n15.6.1.1 \u0007Pacific Biosciences (PacBio)\nThe PacBio depends on the SMRT technology, which was commercialized in 2010\nby Pacific Biosciences (Roberts et al. 2013). This allows us to know about the syn-\nthesis of DNA in real time. This is possible because of the presence of zero-mode\nwaveguide (ZMW) holes where DNA synthesis takes place.\n\f324                                                           N. Gupta and V. K. Verma\n\n   Methodology in brief, single stranded adapters (hairpin adapters) ligated to the\nfragmented DNA, which is then known as capped template. Here to increase the\naccuracy, a strand displacing DNA polymerase is used to sequence the same tem-\nplate several times (Travers et al. 2010). DNA polymerase and template immobilize\nat the base of the ZMW where DNA synthesis takes place (Levene et al. 2003).\nApproximately 75K ZMWs/SMRT cells are present allowing 75K single-molecule\nreactions in parallel fashion. There is concept of physics, which does not allow the\nlaser light (600 nm) to pass completely through the ZMWs (because of zepto-litre\nholes) and it decays exponentially after entering into ZMW. Thus, the laser light\nonly illuminates the 30 nm of the hole. Phospholinked nucleotides of all four types\nsubsequently pass over the ZMWs. The nucleotides get excited and fluoresce when\nreaching the base because laser cannot penetrate up within the hole. Therefore,\nnucleotides cannot be fluoresced till they are present on the surface of the hole.\nHence, polymerization reaction takes place continuously; fluorescent signals can be\ndetected in real time so the sequence can be read (Eid et al. 2009). RS II platform of\nPacific Biosciences, which is commercially available, was released in 2010, whereas\nPacBio Sequel is the latest platform released by Pacific BioSciences in autumn\n2015 in collaboration with Roche Diagnostics for the development of clinical grade\nsequencer for diagnostics. RS II platform is the foremost platform that offers\nsequencing read length >20 Kb and PacBio Sequel is analogous to its former. The\nnew platform PacBio sequel generates almost seven times (~365,000) more number\nof reads than RS II (55,000). The driving force for the long read length is single-­\nmolecule real-time technology in combination with zero-mode waveguides.\n\nAdvantage The reaction can be monitored in real time is the biggest advantage per\nse, which permits to gather the data related to base composition or sequence of the\nDNA template as well as the enzyme kinetics. Difference in enzyme kinetics pro-\nvides us the clue about different modifications present in the DNA like methylation\n(6-methyladenine, 5-methylcytosine) (Flusberg et al. 2010; Fang et al. 2012). With\nthe help of the identification of this modification sites genomewide, the approach\ncan also be used to identify the potential modification present in different genetic\ndiseases. Additional advantage includes longer reads and unbiased data. Moreover,\nusing the SMRT approach, not only DNA, ribosome can also be observed at single-­\nmolecule resolution (Uemura et al. 2010). De novo sequencing can be easily per-\nformed because of the longer read length. Hence, short read allows error in the\nassembly of fragments and formation of scaffold in repeat and GC-rich regions\n(Bahassi el and Stambrook 2014).\n\nLimitation The cost per base sequencing being relatively high and the lower\nthroughput are disadvantages, which limit its use in maximum genomewide studies.\nHigher error rate (insertion and deletion) is the main limitation of the technology\n(Mardis 2011). Along with this, the data generated per run is very less as compared\nto second-generation platforms.\n\f15   Next-Generation Sequencing and Its Application: Empowering in Public Health…   325\n\n\n15.6.2 \u0007True Single-Molecule Real-Time Sequencing\n\nThis technique also provides us the sequence of single molecule of template\nDNA. Hence, evade the requirement of clonal amplification and library preparation\n(Harris et al. 2008). It is also known as single-molecule fluorescent sequencing. In\nthis method, virtual terminators were employed for the fluorescent detection of\nnucleotide. The virtual terminators were introduced in 2009 (Bowers et al. 2009) for\nthe third-generation sequencing technology. Their working methodology is similar\nto the second-generation reversible terminators. However, different fluorescent dyes\nand different blocking groups express different features rendering to structure and\nnucleotide binding region of them. Generally, virtual terminators are made up of\nfree 3’ –OH group, which interacts with DNA polymerase and fluorescent molecule\nbounded with the linker group (Korlach et al. 2010).\n\n15.6.2.1 \u0007Helicos Biosciences (HeliScope)\nThis is the first commercial platform of third generation, which has again revolution-\nized the DNA resequencing technology in 2008. Helicos Biosciences Corporation,\nCambridge MA, USA has launched the HeliScope platform and produces 3 × 107\nreads/channel in a channel slide format (Metzker 2010). In this method, the template\nto be sequenced is fragmented and polyadenylated at the 3’ end by terminal transfer-\nase. The flow cell, which is coated with the oligo-dT containing primers gets hybrid-\nized to poly-A tail present in the fragments. To avoid Poly-A tail sequencing present\nin the fragments, virtual terminators of nucleotides other than dTTP are added in the\ninitial sequencing step. The principle/chemistry of the sequencing is same as for\nsequencing by reversible terminator. Likewise, in the cyclic extension manner tem-\nplate, molecules get sequenced and imaged using CCD camera after cleavage of\nblocking group and fluorescent dye (Thompson and Steinmann 2010). Approximately\n35 GB data can be generated from a single run on this platform.\n\nAdvantage It does not require clonal amplification step, which resulted in reduc-\ntion of biasness. So, it is a beneficial substitute for applications that are mostly\naffected by PCR biasness like RNASeq. This is the first sequencing method able to\nsequence every single nucleotide of each DNA molecule from the fossils, which\nprovide the information regarding DNA damage (Krause et al. 2010). Furthermore,\nthis requires very less concentration of template molecule.\n\nLimitation Despite the advantages, there are some limitations as well, like shorter\nreads and high cost, because of the repetitive sequencing to get the most accurate\ndata by reducing error rates. Shorter reads make it difficult to be used for the de\nnovo sequencing. Also, the technology does not generate the paired end sequences,\nwhich could help in the orientation and location determination of contigs for assem-\nbling of the data. In 2012, Helicos Biosciences announced the impoverishment.\nHowever, SeqLLCompany (Boston MA, USA) provides the services for DNA and\nRNA sequencing using this technology.\n\f326                                                            N. Gupta and V. K. Verma\n\n\n15.6.3 \u0007Ion Semiconductor Sequencing\n\nBasically, this is an extension of the pyrosequencing technology as described by\nAnsorge in 2010. This technology uses a chip (semiconductor), which is fabricated\nwith millions of micro wells. These wells capture the release of proton (H+) during\nthe sequencing followed by change in pH. Proton detected by the technology is the\nproduct other than PPi molecule released during polymerization. This is an amalga-\nmation of semiconductor technique (digital) and chemistry, which allows the\nexpression of chemical signals into digital data (to determine the base call/sequence).\nDNA Electronics in London licensed the principle of this technique, that is, the\ndetection of proton (H+).\n   This is a first commercial sequencing technology, which does not demand for\ncostly optics, lasers and different fluorescently labeled nucleotides for complex\nsequencing chemistries (Ansorge 2016).\n\n15.6.3.1 \u0007Ion Torrent\nIon Torrent released the Personal Genome Machine (PGM), a compact benchtop\nplatform in late 2010 that was later acquired by Life Technologies, Carlsbad,\nUSA. This machine uses the high-density arrays and generates the data usually\n10–20,000 MB per run of up to 400 bp read length in 2–7 hours. It is according to\nthe chip used and also based on application purpose. The basic methodology is\nalmost similar to other NGS technology, which involves fragmentation and ligation\nof adapters. Hybridization to the complementary sequences (primers) bounded with\nthe beads followed by emulsion PCR. After clonal amplification, beads flooded over\nthe semiconductor chip. Each bead goes to the individual well present on the chip\nflowed by the floating of nucleotides sequentially. On incorporation of each nucleo-\ntide by DNA polymerase, a proton (H+) is released, which results in change of the\npH. This change in pH determines the base sequence by changing the chemical\nsignal into digital signal. In homopolymers (more than one same nucleotide incor-\nporated simultaneously), intensity of signal gets high, which is parallel to the pyro-\nsequencing technology (Quail et al. 2012).\n    In the third quarter of 2012, Ion Torrent released its advanced and bigger plat-\nform named Ion Proton. This new platform play an important role in the sequencing\nof whole genomes, transcriptomes and exomes. The data output was up to 10,000 MB\nwith 200 bases read length in a very short duration, that is, two to four hours. The\nplatform has a number of applications including de novo sequencing, ChIP sequenc-\ning, sequencing analysis of the methylation in DNA, small RNA sequencing and\ngene expression analysis. Subsequently, other versions, namely, Ion S5 and Ion S5\nXL, came with their broad range of applications having both low throughput and\nhigh throughput. In reference of throughput, these platforms can be compared to\nIllumina HiSeq platforms.\n\nAdvantage These platforms require very low input of (DNA or RNA) concentra-\ntion (~10 ng) for the identification of mutations and expression profile. Also, the\ntechnology has simplified the analysis of the sequencing data because of the new\n\f15   Next-Generation Sequencing and Its Application: Empowering in Public Health…   327\n\nIon Reporter Software. There are plug-ins and operating software available for data\nanalysis from amplicon sequencing, microbial sequencing, etc. They are widely\naccepted because of the reasonable cost, though they generate shorter reads than\nsome other platforms like PacBio. In simpler words, they are affordable, rapid (run\ncompletes in 2–4 h) and simple and so are suitable for laboratories.\n\nLimitation Major limitation is lack of coverage in sequencing of genomes that\ncontain very high-AT content using Ion Torrent Personal Genome Machine\n(Ballester et al. 2016). Another difficulty in homopolymer sequencing is stretches of\nmore than six same nucleotides trigger deletion and insertion error rate (~1%)\n(Reuter et al. 2015).\n\n\n15.7     \u0007Fourth-Generation Sequencing Technologies\n\nThis generation of the sequencing has the ability to in situ (perform sequencing\ndirectly in the cell) sequence the fixed tissue and cells by using second-generation\nmethodology (Mignardi and Nilsson 2014). Targeted and untargeted methods devel-\noped for in situ RNA sequencing are based on the principle of ligation chemistry.\nFurther, it has the quality to sequence the entire human genome rapidly and authen-\ntically at very low cost, that is, <$1000. Thus, fourth generation has come up with\nthe use in numerous applications like validation of biomarkers and transcriptomic\nanalysis. A group led by Church overcame the limitation present in the Ke’s method\nwhere they gave an idea of partition sequencing to reduce read density. With this\napproach, determination of expression of large number of genes in the cell is pos-\nsible in parallel fashion for several types of RNA. Example: mRNA, rRNA, anti-­\nsense RNA and non-coding RNA (Mignardi and Nilsson 2014). Using in situ\nsequencing method, it is possible to screen the whole cell population with the reso-\nlution of single cell.\n    Fourth-generation platforms based on recent technique, namely, “Spatial\nTranscriptomics,” are in their infantile stage (Stahl et al. 2016). Again, this tech-\nnique is also based upon NGS chemistry for the sequencing. This technique offers\nthe simultaneous visualization and quantitative analysis of the transcriptome (gene\nexpression data) in the fixed tissues. Nanopore-based sequencing method is also\navailable to sequence nucleic acid inexpensively in a short duration.\n\n\n15.7.1 \u0007Nanopore Technology\n\nThough this idea of nanopore sensors based sequencing is very old, it was first\nenvisaged by David Deamer in 1989. This portable technology emerged from coul-\nter counter and ion channels. On the supply of the voltage, particles of smaller size\nthan the pore size circulated across the pore. The read lengths of > 150 Kb can be\nattained. Now, many companies have offered the strategies for nanopore-based\nsequencing. One is NanoTag sequencing by Genia where DNA strand gets excised\n\f328                                                             N. Gupta and V. K. Verma\n\nin monomers followed by their channeling one after another, across a nanopore.\nAnother is strand sequencing by Oxford Nanopore; here, whole single strand of\nDNA passes through a nanopore, which allows the pulling base by base in only one\ndirection (ratcheted) via nanopore. Till now, Oxford Nanopore Technology is the\nmost successful technology for strand sequencing by nanopore.\n\n15.7.1.1 \u0007Oxford Nanopore (MinION)\nMinION is the first nanopore device for sequencing. Oxford Nanopore Technologies,\nUK, licensed it in 2007 and commercialized in May 2014. A flow cell is present at\nthe core of this device in which 2048 individual nanopores are present. They are\ndivided into four groups of 512 nanopores in each group and controlled by\napplication-­specific integrated circuit (ASIC). Brief methodology for sequencing\ninvolves ligation of adapters to the fragments at each end. Adapters enable capture\nof the fragment and polymerase binding at the 5’ ends of the fragments. Additionally,\nthese adapters concentrate the DNA fragments closer to the nanopore, which\nenhances the rate of fragment capture thousandfold. Also, these hairpin-like adapt-\ners allow adjoined sequencing of two complementary strands by covalently attach-\ning the strands to each other. On translocation of a fragment through nanopore, the\npolymerase processes along the template strand and the process repeats for comple-\nmentary strand. The sensor identifies the change in ionic charge when fragments\nmove through the nanopore. The change in the ionic charge or characteristic disrup-\ntion in current is divided into separate events, which ensure associated duration,\nmean amplitude and variance. The series of events is finally interpreted using com-\nputer software/graphical models (e.g., MinKNOW) to identify the nucleotide\nsequence. Finally, the information collected from the template and complementary\nstrands is merged to generate the “2D read.” Another available method for the\nlibrary preparation does not involve the hairpin adapters to covalently connect two\nstrands of the fragments. This method generates the “1D reads”; so in this, nanopore\nreads only template strand. However, this allows high throughput but slightly less\naccuracy in data in comparison to 2D data (Jain et al. 2018).\n\nAdvantage The key advantage of this technology is that the device is able to pro-\nduce long read length > 882 Kb (Quick et al. 2017; Jain et al. 2018). The ultra long\nread length provides the comfort in data alignment and assembly, which lowers the\ncomputational burden. Another advantage is that it is a portable device, which also\nprovides us chance to see the data in real time. MinION is an economic and high\nthroughput device for sequencing of nucleic acid. The biggest advantage of its por-\ntability and mini size is that it has given a chance to look for the opportunity of life\nin outer space (Castro-Wallace et al. 2017). This is the first DNA sequencing plat-\nform used in the cosmos. Major properties of MinION assists in rapid surveillance\nof epidemics like Ebola virus and Zika virus. Nanopore sequencers can also detect\ncytosine modifications in the native DNA (Rand et al. 2017).\n\f15   Next-Generation Sequencing and Its Application: Empowering in Public Health…     329\n\nLimitation One major drawback of the nanopore technology is the higher error\nrate. Recently in the mid of 2016, Oxford Nanopore Technologies launched a newer\nversion of MinION. This platform is based on the newer chemistry known as R9 (R\nstands for reader) and providing the lesser error rates (https://nanoporetech.com/\nabout-us/news/update-new-r9-nanoporefaster-more-accurate-sequencing-and-new-\nten-minutepreparation). However, it is also not up to the mark for frontline applica-\ntions. Currently, the latest version of the technology i.e. R9.4 is getting used in the\nflow cells of the MinION platform. Since the improvements in next-generation tech-\nnologies are taking place very quickly, the limitations of this generation will also be\ntaken care very soon.\n\n   Following are the features why Nanopore sequencers are more suitable for\nsequencing:\n\nThe biggest quality of them is no requirement of fluorescent labeling of the nucleo-\n  tides in sequencing and also provides longer read length. Identification of nucle-\n  otide is based upon the chemical or electronic structure. Compact size\n  (four-inch-long device) of the machine offers the in-field/natural environment\n  experiments possible and it has lower cost of sequencing per run including higher\n  throughput. This MinION platform has the capability to break the set market of\n  $1000 target fixed by the NHGRI, USA.\n\n15.7.1.2 \u0007Oxford Nanopore (ProMethION)\nIn the beginning of year 2017, Oxford Nanopore Technologies delivered its new\nhighest throughput sequencing benchtop platform ProMethION to the laboratories,\nwhich has been commercially available in May 2018. Here, up to 48 flow cells can\nrun independently, each consisting of 3000 channels (nanopores). Oxford Nanopore\nTechnologies promised that ProMethION would perform even better than the best\nplatform by Illumina. They have also assumed the data it will generate per run will\nbe approximately 11 TB when the manufacturing was underway. Currently in 2018,\nit generates approximately 2 TB in 48 h.\n    Now this platform has been placed in many sites in many countries proving that results\ncontinue to rise. In June 2018, more than 100 GB from the individual flow cell of\nProMethION at University of Aalborg was first achieved. In the University of Birmingham,\nat the time of writing of this chapter (first week of August 2018), ProMethION benchtop\nplatform was able to break the record by producing >130 GB data/flow cell (https://nano-\nporetech.com/about-us/news/promethion-wild-2-data-yield-continues-climb).\n\nAdvantage The platform offers on-demand sequencing. It means the researcher\ncan start and stop the run as and when required or utilize more than one flow cell for\nsingle experiment for high throughput and faster speed. Individual flow cells of\n3000 nanopores can be used and it provides almost six times more data compared to\nMinION and GridION. Currently, ProMethION beta system module is in use that\nallows 192 different libraries within the whole device.\n\f330                                                           N. Gupta and V. K. Verma\n\n\n15.7.1.3 \u0007Oxford Nanopore (GridION X5)\nIn early 2017, Oxford Nanopore Technologies released another platform, namely,\nGridION X5. This is a grid collection of five units of MinION with built-in comput-\ning software for the base calling. This allows five queries simultaneously or indi-\nvidually at a time depending upon the requirement of the researcher.\n   This platform also uses the same core technology and is useful in generating\nhuge data (~35 GB in 2017) of long read length along with immediate access to the\ndata in real time like MinION and ProMethION (https://nanoporetech.com/prod-\nucts/gridion). Library preparation is very easy and fast and almost the same that of\nMinION, ProMethION and GridION. It requires very less concentration of sample\n(femtogramfor >40 Kb DNA) and also has versatile and complete range of cDNA\nand gDNA library preparation kits. There are two methods for library preparation\nbased on amplification of library. PCR amplification-based preparation requires\nwhen the starting amount of DNA is low. If we use 20 GridION platforms at a time,\nthen it can sequence the whole human genome in only 15 min with relatively lower\ncost. A compact microfluidic device, VolTrax (programmable Hand Off preparation\nof Sample), is made available by Oxford Nanopore Technologies for the automation\nof library preparation (Leggett and Clark 2017) that is made up of USB-powered\nbase. A consumable cartridge can be placed onto this base with an array of fluid\ncomprising pixels on the surface. The",
