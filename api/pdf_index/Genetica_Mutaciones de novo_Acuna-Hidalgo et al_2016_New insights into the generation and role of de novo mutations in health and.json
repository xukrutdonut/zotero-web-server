Furthermore, UMIs can be used to remove PCR-derived duplicate reads to determine accurately\n the allelic ratio. d Long sequencing reads improve mappability, even across difficult genomic regions such as those containing repeats\n (gray boxes). Additionally, long reads can be used to phase mutations (shown in blue and in green) and generate haplotypes, to help\n identify the parent of origin of a mutation. IV inherited variant.\n Whole-exome sequencing (WES) and whole-genome sequencing (WGS) provide the possibility to perform an untargeted exome- or\n genome-wide analysis of an individual’s DNA and, in theory, detect all the genetic variation present in an individual. By applying these\n approaches in parent–offspring trios, one can determine which variants are inherited and which have occurred as de novo mutations in\n the offspring. The trio design shown in Box Fig. 1a allows investigators to focus directly on the 44 to 82 de novo mutations arising in\n the human genome per generation. Most current technologies rely on re-sequencing, which is short-read sequencing followed by\n mapping and comparison to the human reference genome [199], relying on the raw sequencing quality [200] as well as the mapping\n quality of the NGS reads [201].\n The detection of de novo mutations requires high-quality and high-coverage sequencing (Box Fig. 1b) of three samples; de novo\n mutations need to be detected in the offspring, and the corresponding base pair needs to be called as wild type in both parental\n samples in a reliable manner. Poor quality and/or low sequencing coverage of any one of the three analyzed samples severely compro-\n mises the reliable detection of de novo mutations. Postzygotic de novo mutations represent an additional challenge as mutations are only\n present in a small percentage of cells and, upon sequencing, can resemble false-positive sequencing artifacts. For this type of mutation,\n high sequence coverage is even more crucial. Independent validation by Sanger sequencing (only for validation of germline de novo\n mutations owing to the low sensitivity of the method) and/or targeted NGS approaches remains essential in the case of uncertainty,\n especially if a de novo mutation might be of diagnostic relevance. Improvements in raw sequencing quality and higher-coverage sequencing\n will greatly improve the detection of de novo mutations and allow the consistent identification of postzygotic de novo mutations present in\n small subsets of cells.\n\fAcuna-Hidalgo et al. Genome Biology (2016) 17:241                                                                                      Page 3 of 19\n\n\n\n\n (See box on previous page.)\n A recent improvement for targeted re-sequencing is single-molecule tracing (Box Fig. 1c), which is based on the incorporation of random\n tags or unique molecular identifiers (UMIs) to each DNA molecule during capture. UMIs can be used to remove duplicates from the\n sequencing reads, but they can also allow consensus calling of PCR-derived duplicates of the same DNA molecule [202]. This is of particular\n interest for the study of mosaicism, in which a mutation is present in only a fraction of all analyzed cells, such as postzygotic de novo\n mutations [88].\n In addition, the affordable and widespread use of long sequencing-read technology (Box Fig. 1d) [203] in the coming years is expected\n to improve greatly the detection and characterization (including precise breakpoint mapping, length measurement, and exact copy-\n number state) of small indels, repeat-expansions, as well as CNVs and more-complex structural genomic variation such as inversions and\n chromosomal rearrangements by improving mappability and even allowing for de novo genome assembly [204–206]. For instance,\n long-read sequencing technologies identify 85% of novel indels and CNVs with an average size close to 500 bp that were missed by\n other methods [205]. The application of this technology in parent–offspring trios will provide a better insight into the frequency and role\n of different types of de novo mutations in health and disease. The use of longer sequencing reads is also particularly useful to determine\n the parental origin of a de novo mutation that requires mutation phasing (that is, deriving haplotypes) by making use of inherited SNVs on\n the mutant allele. With currently available short-read sequencing technology, phasing can identify the parental origin for ~20% of de novo\n mutations [13].\n\n\n\napproaches allow us to determine additional characteris-                   (CNVs) in disease [25].

Because of their size,\n CNVs often have a negative effect on fitness and therefore undergo purifying selection. As a result, there are relatively few inherited CNVs\n per genome (approximately 160) [4], and de novo germline CNVs are a well-known cause of severe congenital malformations\n and neurodevelopmental disorders [208–210].\n Genomic microarrays have been instrumental for the initial detection and characterization of CNVs with a size below light-microscope\n resolution [25]. However, NGS has recently shown superior resolution for the detection of CNVs using both short and long sequencing-\n read approaches and data analysis focusing on depth of sequence reads, split reads, and paired-end reads [211, 212]. The rate at which large\n de novo CNVs (over 100,000 bp) arise in the human genome is estimated to lie between 0.01 and 0.02 events per generation [25–27]. The\n mutation rate for indels and CNVs, ranging in size between 10 and 10,000 bp, remains uncertain owing to technical limitations in the\n detection of these events with short-read sequencing technology.\n The CNV mutation rate varies several orders of magnitude depending on the genomic region and parent-of-origin as a result of\n differences in the mechanism by which the de novo CNV arises [213]. Similar to what has been observed for SNVs, non-recurrent\n de novo CNVs also show a strong paternal bias and age effect [15, 214]. This correlation highlights a possible mitotic origin for\n these mutations, resulting from fork stalling and template switching during DNA replication [215]. By contrast, the occurrence of recurrent\n de novo CNVs, many of which cause well-known developmental syndromes [216], is strongly dependent on the underlying genomic architec-\n ture [36]. For instance, the distribution and orientation of segmental duplications (also termed “low-copy repeats”) is known to create “hot spots\n for structural variation” mediating recurrent CNVs by non-allelic homologous recombination during meiosis (NAHR; Fig. 1) [36, 216]. A strong\n maternal bias for these types of CNVs has been observed at specific loci [217], which might be explained by a higher local\n maternal recombination rate. Additionally, for a number of recurrent de novo CNVs, it has been shown that the parental allele\n carries an inversion that places the duplicated flanking regions in tandem. Some of these inversions have reached high frequencies in specific\n populations; for instance, the inversion leading to the so-called H2 haplotype on 17q21 is present in 20% of Europeans [218] and predisposes\n to the occurrence of 17q21 microdeletion syndrome [219].\n\n\npolymerases subsequently verifies the geometry of the                        daughter cells [44].

Clinical interpretation of de novo mutations requires evaluation at the level of the affected locus or gene, as well\n as at the variant level [221].\n For the interpretation of candidate disease-causing de novo mutations, it is important to verify that the phenotype of the patient\n with the identified mutation matches that of patients described in the literature possessing similar mutations. Next, the de novo\n mutation can be evaluated by the same methods used to interpret inherited variations, such as in silico prediction programs such as SIFT,\n PolyPhen, MutationTaster, and CADD [221–224]. Traditionally, evidence linking a gene or a mutation to a phenotype has been established\n experimentally [221, 223], although functional validation is laborious and the necessary assays can differ per gene and per mutation. Many\n recent developments can support the interpretation of de novo mutations in human disease. For instance, to study the consequences of a\n mutation, induced pluripotent stem cells from patient-derived samples can be differentiated into cell types relevant for the respective disease\n [225]. Furthermore, as a robust method for in vitro and in vivo genetic manipulation, the “clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic\n repeats” CRISPR–Cas9 system can be used to establish cell and animal models for functional studies [226, 227]. Other CRISPR/Cas9-based\n methods, such as “saturation genome editing”, hold promise for the evaluation of hundreds of mutations in a single assay [228], allowing the\n interpretation of de novo mutations to keep pace with their discovery in the genomics era.\n Replication is essential to establish the link between de novo mutations in a novel disease gene and a phenotype [189]. This initially\n involves the identification of de novo mutations in the same gene in two or more individuals sharing a similar phenotype. However,\n large-scale parent–offspring sequencing studies have made apparent that this, by itself, is not sufficient to establish causality for a disease\n [221]. The number of de novo events identified in a specific gene in individuals with the same phenotype must exceed the expected\n background rate of de novo mutations, which depends on specific features of each gene, such as its size, sequence, and constraint [126].\n This approach has been used successfully to identify new disease genes for autism spectrum disorders [229], epileptic encephalopathies [31],\n and intellectual disability [128]. A novel way to find more patients with de novo mutations in the same gene is emerging from genetic\n matchmaking platforms such as Matchmaker exchange (http://www.matchmakerexchange.org/) [230] or GeneMatcher (https://www.gene-\n matcher.org/) [231], which enable easy data sharing. Establishing unequivocally a link between a genotype and a phenotype requires the same\n meticulousness in patient phenotyping as in their genotyping, and objective criteria are needed to be able to compare clinical features in\n patients. For large heterogeneous patient cohorts, systematic phenotyping, including an assessment in Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO)\n terms, can prove beneficial and increase the diagnostic yield in exome sequencing [127, 232–234].\n Large-scale databases of genetic variation can be used to see whether a gene or gene region shows constraint against variation in\n controls, as the frequency of a mutation in the population is often a good indirect estimation of its pathogenicity [223]. To this end, RVIS\n and selective constraint scores have become routine in the interpretation of de novo variants, both in research and in the clinic [126, 188].\n Population databases, such as the Exome Aggregation Consortium (ExAC) [55], are expected to be depleted of de novo disease-causing\n mutations for severe and early-onset disorders. Given that de novo mutations are the rarest type of variation, the absence of a mutation from\n the ExAC database is not in itself sufficient evidence for its pathogenicity. By contrast, the presence of a mutation in ExAC does not\n automatically entail that the mutation is not disease causing. Pathogenic mutations involved in dominant disease are present in ExAC [55],\n which might be explained by variable penetrance for these variants [235], the presence of false-positive variants in the control database [236],\n or undiagnosed disease in control individuals. Possible other explanations for these observations could be the presence of these mutations\n as somatic events in control individuals [106–108] or resilience to disease in a few selected individuals [237].\n\n\n\n\nA > G transitions [11].
