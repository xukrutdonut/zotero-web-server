X-inactivation silences all X\ntranscribe their gene-rich human X chromosomes, which is                           chromosomes but one; therefore, both males and females have a\noften underappreciated as a cause of sex differences in                            single active X.10,11\ndisease.6 Males are the usual ones affected by X-linked                               For 46 XY males, that X is the only one they have; it always\npathogenic variants.6 Females are biologically superior; a                         comes from their mother, as fathers contribute their Y\nfemale usually has no disease, or much less severe disease                         chromosome. However, because X chromosomes are silenced\nthan the male with the same variant, unless she is                                 in a random fashion, females usually have two kinds of cells in\nhomozygous for the deleterious allele, or it is lethal for                         every tissue; those with their maternal X active and those with\nmales.                                                                             an active paternal X. Females are protected to a large extent\n   The X chromosome carries 867 known protein coding                               because their two X chromosomes most often differ in genetic\ngenes.7 Clearly, pathogenic variants that induce complete loss                     content.\nof function may be lethal to fetuses of both sexes; however, a                        Sex differences in diseases due to deleterious variants\nnumber of these pathogenic variants—less severe, or occur-                         encoded by the X chromosome originate from the sex\nring in less-essential genes—cause at least 533 X-linked                           difference in the expression of the variant allele; if present\ndiseases8 that affect males more severely.8 Rather                                 in male tissues, it is expressed in every cell, but if present in\nthan influencing sexual development, most of these genes                           female tissues, the variant is usually expressed in only half the\nplay a role in nonreproductive human tissues, including                            cells (Fig. 1).\nbrain, bone, blood, ears, heart, liver, kidney, retina, skin,\nand teeth.
