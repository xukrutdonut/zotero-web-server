Current disease models for DM1 and DM2 propose a common pathomechanism, whereby\n the transcription of mutant DMPK (DM1) and CNBP (DM2) genes results in the synthesis of CUG\n and CCUG repeat expansion (CUGexp , CCUGexp ) RNAs, respectively. These CUGexp and CCUGexp\n RNAs are toxic since they promote the assembly of ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complexes or RNA foci,\n leading to sequestration of Muscleblind-like (MBNL) proteins in the nucleus and global dysregulation\n of the processing, localization and stability of MBNL target RNAs. STR expansion RNAs also\n form phase-separated gel-like droplets both in vitro and in transiently transfected cells, implicating\n RNA-RNA multivalent interactions as drivers of RNA foci formation. Importantly, the nucleation\n and growth of these nuclear foci and transcript misprocessing are reversible processes and thus\n amenable to therapeutic intervention. In this review, we provide an overview of potential DM1 and\n DM2 pathomechanisms, followed by a discussion of MBNL functions in RNA processing and how\n multivalent interactions between expanded STR RNAs and RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) promote\n RNA foci assembly.\n\n Keywords: myotonic dystrophy; ALS/FTD; microsatellite expansion; STR; alternative splicing; MBNL;\n RBFOX; CELF; phase separation; foci\n\n\n\n\n1. Introduction\n     Repetitive DNA sequence elements compose 50–70% of the human genome [1,2]. These repetitive\nsequences include interspersed transposable elements (DNA transposons, RNA retrotransposons)\nand tandem repeats, including telomeric and centromeric repeats as well as micro-, mini- and mega-,\nsatellites. Microsatellites or short tandem repeats (STRs) composed of 2–10 base pairs (bp), are\nhighly polymorphic in the human population [3]. Their propensity to form unusual quadruplex-like,\nslipped-stranded structures and imperfect hairpins results in an elevated level of DNA replication\nand repair errors that can lead to STR contractions or expansions [4,5]. While these repeat expansion\nlength variations may serve to fine-tune regulatory activities of the STR host gene, more than 50\nhereditary neurological, neuromuscular and other diseases are associated with expansions in coding\nand noncoding regions as well as in promoters (Figure 1). STR expansion diseases are caused by\na variety of AT- and GC-rich tandem repeat sequences. While GC-rich trinucleotide expansions\npredominate in exonic regions, intronic repeats are composed of 3-6 nucleotide tandems and vary\nconsiderably in GC content.\n\n\n\n\nInt. J. Mol.

Myotonic Dystrophy Type 1 (DM1) and Congenital Myotonic\n      Dystrophy (CDM)–DMPK [55]; Huntington Disease-Like 2 (HDL2)–JPH3 [56]; SCA8–ATXN8OS [42].\n\n      Although DNA repeat expansions are the primary cause of the associated disorder, the downstream\npathomechanisms underlying development of the disease phenotype have remained unclear for\nthe majority of these diseases. Possible STR expansion disease mechanisms include host gene\nhaploinsufficiency, host gene transcript misprocessing [57,58], bidirectional gene transcription [59],\nrepeat-mediated RBP sequestration [60], canonical translation of toxic polyglutamine and polyalanine\nproteins [61,62] and non-canonical repeat-associated non-AUG (RAN) translation [63]. Of course,\nthese pathomolecular events may and often do, co-occur in an expansion disease. For example, in\nC9orf72 amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and frontotemporal dementia (C9-ALS/FTD), the C9orf72 intron 1\nGGGGCC expansion (GGGGCCexp ) results in alternative first exon selection, intron 1 retention, altered\nsense and antisense transcription, sequestration of multiple repeat-binding proteins (e.g., HNRNPH1,\nRanGAP1) and RAN translation of dipeptide repeats (DPRs) [64].\n      In this review, we focus on two related multisystemic disorders, myotonic dystrophy (DM) type 1\n(DM1) and type 2 (DM2), which have served as a paradigm of RNA-mediated diseases. Although DM1\nis caused by a DMPK 3’ untranslated region (3’UTR) CTGexp and DM2 by an intronic CCTGexp in CNBP,\nthey share a number of pathological features including skeletal muscle myotonia and weakness/wasting,\nheart conduction block, unusual dust-like ocular cataracts and cognitive dysfunction (Figure 2). Below,\nwe evaluate different disease mechanisms for DM1 and DM2 in the context of other microsatellite\nexpansion disorders followed by a more detailed analysis of the pathogenic roles of toxic CUGexp and\nCCUGexp in RNA processing.\n\n2. Is Myotonic Dystrophy Caused by Haploinsufficiency?\n     Loss-of-function mechanisms are well documented in Friedreich’s ataxia (FRDA) and a number of\nfolate-sensitive fragile sites, including Fragile XA syndrome (FRAXA) where microsatellite expansions\ninduce epigenetic changes that result in transcriptional repression (Figure 1) [65,66]. However, several\nobservations argue against a haploinsufficiency or host gene loss-of-function, model for either DM1 or\nDM2. First, neither DMPK nor CNBP coding region mutations have been reported to cause DM. Second,\nboth DM1 and DM2 are classified as myotonic dystrophies but DM1 is caused by DMPK CTGexp\nand DM2 by CNBP CCTGexp , mutations and these two genes are located on different chromosomes\nand encode proteins with very different functions. DMPK is a serine/threonine protein kinase while\nCNBP is a CCHC-type zinc finger (ZnF) protein. DMPK is expressed as six major isoforms and is a\nmember of the AGC kinase family [67,68] while CNBP has been implicated in both transcriptional\nand post-transcriptional regulation and a recent study demonstrated that this ZnF protein binds to\nG-rich RNA elements to block G-quadruplex structures and enhance translation [69]. Third, the\nDMPK CTGexp mutation results in the retention of DMPK mRNA in the nucleus and depletion of\nDMPK protein but neither Dmpk heterozygous nor homozygous knockout mice recapitulate the major\npathological features of DM1 [70–72].\n     For DM2, the CCTGexp mutation does not inhibit CNBP transcription [73]. The CCTGexp is located\nin an intron so splicing should allow nucleocytoplasmic export of CNBP mRNA. Although CNBP\nintron 1 retention occurs in DM2 this partially spliced mRNA is exported from the nucleus [58]. The\neffect of the CCTGexp mutation on CNBP protein expression in DM2 is controversial with either no\n\fInt. J. Mol.

Interestingly, CNBP re-localizes\nfrom the cytoplasm to the sarcolemma where it interacts with α-dystroglycan in DM2 muscle biopsies,\nalthough the molecular basis for CNBP re-localization is unclear since mutant and wild-type CNBP\nalleles produce the same protein [80]. Nevertheless, the discrepancy between CNBP protein levels in\n Int. J. Mol.

CNBP downregulation has also been noted in a zebrafish model of Treacher Collins syndrome, a\ncraniofacial disorder caused by mutations in TCOF1 that encodes the treacle protein involved in rDNA\ntranscription [99]. Interestingly, forebrain truncation and craniofacial defects have also been observed\nin Cnbp knockout mice [97]. Cumulatively, these findings argue that DMPK haploinsufficiency is not a\nmajor DM1 disease factor but a potential role for CNBP loss-of-function in DM2 requires further study.\n\n3. DM1 and DM2 Are RNA-mediated Disorders\n      In contrast to the dysregulation of host gene expression, transcription of microsatellite expansion\nmutations independent of the host gene context results in the synthesis of toxic STR RNAs. Thornton\nand colleagues provided evidence for CUGexp toxicity by the generation and characterization of HSALR\ntransgenic mice, in which a CTG~250 mutation was inserted into the 3’UTR of a human skeleton\nactin (HSA) transgene [100]. HSALR mice develop several manifestations of DM1 muscle, including\nmyotonia, with pathological severity dependent on transgene expression level.\n      Both the RNA sequences and structures of STR expansions have been implicated as pathogenic\nfactors and AU/GC composition influences the propensity of these expansions to form higher order RNA\nstructures. In silico prediction of secondary structures formed by expanded microsatellites indicates\nthat the majority of AU-rich repeats are primarily single-stranded compared to those formed by GC-rich\nSTRs [58,101,102]. For instance, DM1 CUG and DM2 CCUG repeats form stable imperfect hairpins\nwith one or two unpaired nucleotides while the C9-ALS/FTD GGGGCC repeats form G-quadruplex\nstructures [103–105]. In addition, inherited mutation length increases during an affected individual’s\nlifespan, particularly in post-mitotic cells and results in different cells expressing varying repeat\nlengths [106–109]. Due to this somatic mosaicism, DMPK mutant allele repeat expansions are readily\ndetectable in blood cells but expansions in skeletal muscles may be much larger and reach thousands of\nCTG repeats with variable repeat lengths in different myonuclei [110,111]. Current evidence indicates\nsomatic expansion is one of the triggers of pathological onset, however in some tissues there is no\nclear correlation between expansion size and disease severity [112]. Moreover, exceptionally large\nmicrosatellite expansions in noncoding regions are not always associated with greater disease severity.\nFor instance, DM2 is caused by up to 11,000 CCTG repeats in CNBP intron 1 but this disease is generally\nrecognized as a less severe type of myotonic dystrophy distinguished by relatively late-onset and lack\nof a congenital form [113].\n      Why are STR expansion RNAs toxic? In DM1 and DM2, CUGexp and CCUGexp RNAs adversely\naffect the activities of several developmentally regulated RNA splicing factors in human tissues, cells\nand animal models (Figure 3) [114,115]. For example, in DM1 skeletal muscle and heart, expression of\nCUGexp RNA leads to protein kinase C (PKC)-mediated CELF1 hyperphosphorylation [116,117]. Since\nCELF1 promotes fetal alternative splicing patterns, CUGexp expression and CELF1 overexpression plays\na role in the reversion to fetal splicing patterns in adult tissues [118,119]. These mis-splicing events have\nbeen linked to specific pathophysiological outcomes including myotonia, muscle weakness/wasting,\nheart conduction block and insulin resistance. It is unclear if CELF1 is upregulated in DM2 [79,117,120].\n\fInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2019, 20, 3365                                                                                          6 of 20\nInt.
