Moreover, a judicious choice of TR (40–\n50 ms) and careful selection of the imaging plane per-\npendicular to the direction of ﬂow may further decrease\nthe spin saturation eﬀects. Intravoxel spin phase disper-\nsion may be overcome by the use of smaller voxel sizes,\nthinner slices, and short TE (7–9 ms) [1]. Saturation ef-\nfects can also be minimized by using lower ﬂip angles (15–\n20\u0002) in combination with longer TRs, thiner slices, and\nthe shortest possible TE [5]. The variable ﬂip-angle\nexcitation technique, termed ‘‘tilted optimized nonsatu-\nrating excitation’’, has also been shown to increase the\nsignal and lower the spin phase dispersion eﬀect within\nthe vessels [6].
