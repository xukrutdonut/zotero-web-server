CMA may not detect\n                            balanced cytogenomic abnormalities or uniparental disomy (UPD), and deletion/duplications and\n                            regions of homozygosity may require additional testing to clarify the mechanism and inform\n                            accurate counseling. We conducted an evidence review to synthesize data regarding the benefit of\n                            additional testing after CMA to inform a genetic diagnosis.\n\n                            Methods: The review was guided by key questions related to the detection of genomic events that\nAuthor Manuscript\n\n\n\n\n                            may require additional testing. A PubMed search for original research articles, systematic reviews,\n                            and meta-analyses were evaluated from articles published between January 1, 1983 and March 31,\n                            2017. Based on the key questions, articles were retrieved and data extracted in parallel with\n                            comparison of results and discussion to resolve discrepancies. Variables assessed included study\n                            design and outcomes.\n\n                            Results: A narrative synthesis was created for each question to describe the occurrence of, and\n                            clinical significance of, additional diagnostic findings from subsequent testing performed after\n                            CMA.\n\n                            Conclusion: These findings may be used to assist the laboratory and clinician when making\n                            recommendations about additional testing after CMA, as it impacts clinical care, counseling, and\n                            diagnosis.\nAuthor Manuscript\n\n\n\n\n                       Keywords\n                            Balanced rearrangement; Chromosomal microarray; genetic testing; mosaicism; UPD\n\n\n\n\n                                            Genet Med.

The\n                                      American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG) guideline states that\n                                      ordering providers should be aware of cytogenomic aberrations not detectable by CMA,\n                                      including those relevant to various microarray platforms (e.g., single nucleotide\n                                      polymorphism (SNP) versus oligonucleotide).2 The rationale for this document is that\nAuthor Manuscript\n\n\n\n\n                                      additional testing is often done if the results are negative, or to determine if an abnormal\n                                      finding is familial or de novo, or to identify the underlying mechanism of an abnormal\n                                      finding, which could also have importance for family counseling. There is variability\n                                      between laboratory practices with respect to follow-up testing (e.g., fluorescence in situ\n                                      hybridization (FISH) or quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) to confirm variants\n                                      or identify the mechanism of copy number variants. Until now, there has been no SER to\n                                      summarize how often specific cytogenomic aberrations are undetected by CMA alone or\n                                      when additional testing is needed to clarify the mechanism of abnormal findings; this\n                                      information is important for clinical decision-making regarding the need or benefit of\n                                      additional testing following CMA.\n\n                                      At the request of the ACMG Professional Practice and Guidelines committee, we convened a\nAuthor Manuscript\n\n\n\n\n                                      working group in December 2014 to conduct an evidence review.\n\n                                      The working group devised the following key questions:\n\n                                          1.     What types of genomic abnormalities (e.g., balanced rearrangement, mosaicism,\n                                                 and uniparental disomy) that may not be reliably detected by CMA are identified\n                                                 with other related tests such as karyotype or fluorescence in situ hybridization\n                                                 (FISH) in a child with unexplained developmental delay, intellectual disability,\n                                                 congenital anomalies, or autism spectrum disorder, and what are the frequencies\n                                                 of these genomic abnormalities when there are (a) normal CMA results or (b)\n                                                 abnormal CMA results?\n\n                                          2.     Does management change as a result of additional testing that identifies a\n                                                 pathogenic abnormality not detected by CMA or that further clarifies the original\nAuthor Manuscript\n\n\n\n\n                                                 CMA findings?\n\n                                      The evidence review group (ERG) expanded these key questions according to categories of\n                                      genomic events. Questions were developed using the AHRQ Effective Healthcare Program\n                                      that includes the use of the PICOTS framework (Population, Intervention, Comparison,\n                                      Outcomes, Timing and Setting) of the topic to be reviewed. Key questions were drafted by\n                                      individuals within the ERG and then agreed upon by the entire group (Supplemental Table\n                                      1).\n\n\n                                           Genet Med.

BALANCED REARRANGEMENTS\n                                      CMA will not detect balanced rearrangements, such as balanced translocations, insertions,\n                                      or balanced inversions which may be detected by karyotype or FISH.

Parental studies can provide information as to whether a\n                                      rearrangement is de novo versus inherited. While inheritance status does not always predict\n                                      pathogenicity, it is likely to be more so in de novo cases. A limited number of publications\n                                      have investigated the phenotypic consequences of balanced rearrangements, as it can be\n                                      difficult to determine causation due to disruption and/or dysregulation of gene expression.\nAuthor Manuscript\n\n\n\n\n                                      These studies indicate that an apparently balanced rearrangement at the G-banding level may\n                                      be associated with or causative of the phenotype in less than half of cases in the setting of a\n                                      patient with congenital anomalies or intellectual disability.12–16 Further details are\n                                      summarized in Supplemental material.\n\n                                      Notably, these studies and others investigating apparently balanced rearrangements found\n                                      clinically relevant imbalances seemingly unrelated to the breakpoints of the primary\n                                      rearrangements (e.g., distant to the breakpoint or on a different chromosome). If these cases\n                                      had been studied by CMA first, the imbalance would have been detected but the unrelated\n                                      balanced rearrangement would have been missed. This observation indicates that some\n                                      patients with an abnormal phenotype and a pathogenic CNV could also have a concomitant\n                                      balanced rearrangement not detected by CMA. In a case series of 33 subjects, two out of\nAuthor Manuscript\n\n\n\n\n                                      seven cases with a balanced rearrangement had CNVs distant from the balanced breakpoints.\n                                      17 Additional research will be needed to estimate the frequency of this occurrence. It is\n\n                                      unclear if the co-occurrence of a balanced rearrangement and an unrelated CNV has a\n                                      combined effect on the phenotype, or the frequency with which this type of event occurs, but\n                                      it may not be uncommon.\n\n                       (2.)    CHROMOSOMAL MOSAICISM\n                                      Six studies addressing incidence and detection of mosaicism were included. Chromosomal\n                                      mosaicism (whole or segmental) detected by CMA analysis, typically from a peripheral\n                                      blood specimen (sometimes from fibroblasts), was present in approximately 0.5%−1.2% of\n                                      individuals with unexplained DD, ID, ASD, and MCA.18–23 The ability to detect mosaicism\n                                      appeared to be increased with CMA due to the greater sensitivity of molecular testing\nAuthor Manuscript\n\n\n\n\n                                      technologies as compared to cytogenetic techniques.

DETECTION OF REGIONS OF HOMOZYGOSITY (ROH) AND UNIPARENTAL DISOMY\n                       (UPD)\n                                      Seven studies that addressed ROH and UPD were included. In addition to copy number\n                                      variation, SNP arrays may detect copy neutral regions of homozygosity (ROH) through the\n                                      targeting of biallelic markers dispersed throughout the genome. Large segments of copy\n                                      neutral ROH may be clinically significant as an indicator of uniparental disomy (UPD) or\n                                      may reflect inheritance of a genomic segment from a common ancestor - identity by descent\n                                      (IBD). ROH reflecting IBD has been observed in many different epidemiologic studies of\n                                      healthy members of the general population.30 In some cases where an autosomal recessive\n                                      mode of inheritance is suspected, identification of ROH may aid the diagnostic evaluation by\n                                      uncovering a gene in which a homozygous pathogenic mutation resides.\nAuthor Manuscript\n\n\n\n\n                                      Although SNP array can be suggestive of UPD, all cases of UPD may not be detected, and\n                                      detection rates may vary between laboratories. Detection varies based on the specifics of the\n                                      UPD (i.e., isodisomy versus heterodisomy, whole chromosome versus segmental). In one\n                                      study, more than 95% of patients with Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome from paternal UPD\n                                      were detected by SNP array, as many of these were due to segmental UPD.31 In contrast,\n                                      Prader-Willi Syndrome (PWS) was frequently due to heterodisomy, although meiotic\n                                      recombination sometimes leads to a region of isodisomy with a corresponding lower\n                                      detection rate by SNP array.32 Therefore, additional testing may be warranted to assess UPD\n                                      depending on the clinical phenotype.\n\n                                      In general, reportable ROH are 3–10 megabases in size. In large population studies, ROH\n                                      were found in 5–10% of cases.23, 33, 34 In two large cohort studies, 70–80% of individuals\nAuthor Manuscript\n\n\n\n\n                                      with ROH had involvement of at least two chromosomes, suggestive of IBD.33, 34 Efforts to\n                                      refine cases of ROH that were suspicious for UPD have been successful. Criteria were\n                                      developed to define a “UPD signature” and prospectively test 46 cases with ROH suspicious\n                                      for underlying UPD.35 This study found that further testing confirmed UPD in as many as\n                                      29/46 (63%) cases. Criteria used for suspected UPD included ROH involving only a single\n                                      chromosome (especially one that was known to be associated with a UPD phenotype) and\n                                      telomeric ROH.35 Another study identified 11 cases to be suspicious for UPD, either due to\n                                      mapping to a chromosome with a known human imprinting disorder or due to involvement\n\n\n                                           Genet Med.

Several studies have reported whether the ROH\n                                      mapped to chromosomes with known human imprinting disorders or imprinted genes. One\n                                      study reported that in 12/19 cases involving a single chromosome, the ROH mapped to a\n                                      chromosome with a known human imprinting disorder.33 Another study found single\n                                      chromosome ROH mapping to chromosome 14 in seven cases, but two cases had\n                                      confirmation testing that was negative for UPD.34 Finally, one study reported that\n                                      approximately 50% of their cases mapped to a chromosome with imprinted genes and/or had\n                                      a recognizable imprinting disorder phenotype.35\n\n                                      Under certain specific clinical circumstances, ROH that is indicative of IBD may be used to\nAuthor Manuscript\n\n\n\n\n                                      narrow the search for a causative gene wherein a homozygous variant causing an autosomal\n                                      recessive (AR) disease is suspected. It appears that this occurs only rarely (~1% of cases\n                                      with ROH) as reported in two large studies.23, 33 In the setting of parental consanguinity\n                                      and/or results consistent with close parental relatedness, an AR single gene disorder was\n                                      diagnosed in four patients from two families for a yield of 4/59 (7%).33\n\n\n                       DISCUSSION\n                                      The goal of this evidence review is to synthesize the literature regarding diagnostic yield\n                                      and, where possible, clinical significance of additional testing after either a normal or\n                                      abnormal CMA. Additional testing is considered either to clarify further CMA results or to\n                                      detect genomic events, which cannot be detected by CMA.\nAuthor Manuscript\n\n\n\n\n                                      It is known that there are certain types of genomic abnormalities not detected by CMA\n                                      (simple and complex apparently balanced rearrangements, etc.). CMA results do not\n                                      determine the genetic mechanism associated with a CNV and, therefore, are limited in the\n                                      ability to inform family counseling. SNP array findings may suggest certain abnormalities\n                                      such as UPD and IBD, but cannot confirm their clinical significance. In these situations,\n                                      additional testing is warranted to inform further clinical significance and family counseling.\n\n                                      We have described the occurrence of additional genomic events in the presence of both\n                                      normal and abnormal CMA results in a defined population. These results can be utilized to\n                                      inform the likelihood of additional testing having clinical implications. The published\n                                      literature mostly focuses on describing the incidence of the genetic abnormalities\n                                      investigated in this review, and were not designed to assess clinical outcomes or cost-benefit\nAuthor Manuscript\n\n\n\n\n                                      analysis.

BALANCED REARRANGEMENTS\n                                      A negative or normal CMA may miss a balanced rearrangement or possible mosaicism.\n                                      Approximately 0.8% of cases with negative CMA results will be expected to have a\n                                      balanced rearrangement (e.g., translocation, inversion, insertion) that would be detected by a\n                                      karyotype.8 We believe this could be an underestimate because karyotype can additionally\n                                      detect other structurally abnormal chromosomes, such as rings and markers, which were not\n                                      included in the search of the literature when examining this specific question. This review\n                                      focused specifically on a postnatal population with a defined phenotype and does not\n                                      account for every clinical scenario that may be encountered. There are other circumstances\nAuthor Manuscript\n\n\n\n\n                                      that may be clinically suggestive of the need for a karyotype after normal CMA, including\n                                      prenatal findings of clinical abnormalities or a family history suggestive of a balanced\n                                      rearrangement.\n\n                                      A balanced rearrangement may interrupt a gene or dysregulate gene expression and hence be\n                                      the pathogenic cause of the patient’s phenotype. However, given an incidence of 0.78%\n                                      −1.3% for missed balanced events,8–10 overall it is estimated that such an event could be the\n                                      cause of an abnormal phenotype in about 0.56%−0.91% of all cases with normal CMA.\n\n                                      Sequencing has tremendous potential to determine the nature and effect of the breakpoints\n                                      on specific genes. A recently published large cohort study suggests that balanced\n                                      rearrangements are often associated with genomic imbalances < 10 kb, direct gene\nAuthor Manuscript\n\n\n\n\n                                      disruption/truncation, or modulation of long-range regulatory interactions; the expression\n                                      and known function of genes involved in these disruptions are suggestive of their role in\n                                      causing a phenotype.37 A prenatal study similarly showed disruption of regulatory domains\n                                      and the associated genes can be predictive of the phenotype.38 We believe these studies\n                                      provide further evidence of the importance of incorporating sequencing technology into the\n                                      investigation and interpretation of cytogenomic abnormalities. The clinical consequence of\n                                      these disruptions is related to more than just the gene(s) involved in the translocation,\n                                      deletion, or duplication, but is also related to the change in gene expression from disrupted\n                                      regulatory domains.\n\n                                      Overall, we find that the data support balanced rearrangements associated with or causative\n                                      of the phenotype in a meaningful proportion of cases in the setting of a patient with\n                                      congenital anomalies or intellectual disability.
