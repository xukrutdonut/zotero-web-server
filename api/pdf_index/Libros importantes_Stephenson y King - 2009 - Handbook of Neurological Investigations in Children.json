We would also\nlike to thank the family of the late Stuart Green, the families of the many children\nincluded, and in particular the family of Malcolm, who is in the first vignette.\n\nSome details of the children in several of the vignettes have appeared in various medical\njournals and we thank them for permission to publish.\n\nWe are indebted to Bernie Larkin and Andrew Patton for assistance with the preparation\nof the manuscript and to Jean Hyslop for additional images.\n\nHilary Hart, Caroline Black and Udoka Ohuonu of Mac Keith Press have been very\npatient and greatly supportive. Without Pat Chappelle, there would not be a book.\n\n\n                                                                                              ix\n\f                                                    1\n                                                    2\n                                                    3\n                                                    4\n                                                    5\n                                                    6\n                                                    7\n                                                    8\n                                                    9\n                                                    10\n                                                    11\n                                                    12\n                                                    13\n                                                    14\n                                                    15\n                                                    16\n                                                    17\n                                                    18\n“Without patients, knowledge is only knowledge”     19\n                                                    20\n                               (Takashi Shiihara)   21\n                                                    22\n                                                    23\n                                                    24\n                                                    25\n                                                    26\n                                                    27\n                                                    28\n                                                    29\n                                                    30\n                                                    31\n                                                    32\n                                                    33\n                                                    34\n                                                    35\n                                                    36\n                                                    37\n                                                    38\n                                                    39\n                                                    40\n                                                    41\n                                                    42\n                                                    43\n                                                    44\n                                                    45\n                                                    46\n\f1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n                                                     Foreword\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19   In days not so long ago when there were few tests excepting biopsy or postmortem\n20   against which the surmises of history and clinical examination could be tested, great\n21   neurological textbooks were nonetheless written by the likes of Kinnier Wilson, Frank\n22   Ford, Ray Adams and others. A remarkable and important quality of such texts was their\n23   capacity to teach us how to select historical details and observe clinical findings that\n24   guided us toward a correct formulation. Such texts manifested analytical honesty,\n25   practicality, and exceptional judgment, each having a particular ‘personality’. The reader\n26   of such texts thus acquired sufficient confidence and authority to allay appropriately the\n27   uncertainty and anxiety of patients and their families, and they placed generations of\n28   readers in a position to refine the classification of diagnoses, accuracy of tests, and\n29   efficacy of treatments. In doing so they acquired facility in dealing with the uncertainties\n30   not only of the precise nature of neurological disease, but also those concerning the\n31   validity of tests, since in most there is a degree of imprecision and potential false-\n32   positivity. Errors in the selection or omission of appropriate confirmatory tests carried\n33   the risk of missing the point entirely, for which the consequences included\n34   inappropriate prognostication, a lack of genetic counselling, and inappropriate or\n35   untried treatments.\n36\n37   Upon this foundation a quite remarkable edifice of clinical and scientific sophistication\n38   has been constructed. If so much less was known, those intellectual ancestors were\n39   observant, experienced, critical thinkers who took great pride and satisfaction in\n40   acquiring exceptional skill at dealing with what they knew within the context of what\n41   was not yet known. The past three decades have, with astonishing and rapidly\n42   accelerating speed, filled in so many details and brought forward concepts and\n43   mechanisms that have made memorization of detail less burdensome, so improving the\n44   power of both our questions and our observations. With this great wealth of\n45   information, few general neurological texts are now the product of one or a few authors.\n46   There are exceptions: those of Aicardi (with a few remarkable associates) and Volpe are\n\n\n                                                                                                    xi\n\f      among the very small group that retain the particular virtue of the older texts, a             1\n      personality that retains the integrity of method and point of view that can be so              2\n      instructive, upon which one may model a durable and practical approach to the                  3\n      uncertainties of diagnosis that will prove both satisfying and productive.                     4\n                                                                                                     5\n      In their Introduction to this handbook, Professors King and Stephenson raise                   6\n      themselves the question as to what possible use there might be for this work, since there      7\n      is now such a plethora of information concerning the neurological diseases of children,        8\n      their manifestations, pathogenesis, treatment, and outcome. Their excuse is to provide         9\n      “a paper compendium of guidance on principle” together with a “philosophy of tests.”           10\n      This is a very modest description of this very remarkable handbook. What Professors            11\n      King and Stephenson have done is to enrich and enable the success with which those             12\n      who approach children with neurological diseases will utilize this wealth of                   13\n      information. They have provided an element that may be lost in the midst of so much            14\n      information – the kind of judgment that only extensive experience and the tendency to          15\n      ask difficult questions are able to generate. They organize our desire to confirm our          16\n      formulations around the principle that we must first have formulated well and that our         17\n      tests must be specifically selected to affirm or discredit that formulation. Armed with        18\n      exceptionally sophisticated knowledge of clinical child neurology they have taken on a         19\n      glittering array of tests in order to help us organize our approach to them.                   20\n                                                                                                     21\n      This handbook is well organized, and the well-selected references are remarkably               22\n      current. The principles of test selection are highly enriched with diagnostic tips, and the    23\n      approach is illustrated with an instructive array of clinical vignettes. For busy academics,   24\n      the vignettes themselves will provide an excellent aid to teaching our successors how to       25\n      become judicious physicians. For scientists, this handbook is a reminder that their            26\n      chances of identifying pertinent genes and elucidating disease mechanisms are far              27\n      greater if they adhere to the valuable principles of formulation advocated in this book.       28\n      Professors King and Stephenson obviously savor the ever richer opportunities for               29\n      diagnostic testing but are evidently keenly aware of Aicardi’s prediction, now nearly          30\n      twenty years old, that “spectacular future progress in imaging … neurophysiological or         31\n      other laboratory examinations … will remain of little value when applied                       32\n      indiscriminately without a previous careful [clinical] analysis.” They are aware that the      33\n      concept that “screening tests” for neurological disease might soon replace the adept           34\n      clinician is a very dangerous one. They are just the sort of exceptionally adept clinicians    35\n      and thinkers as are qualified to show us how to make the best use of what has become           36\n      available to us to answer the questions posed so anxiously by children with neurological       37\n      dysfunction and their families.                                                                38\n
