CONLIN\n\n\n                With the introduction of increasingly sensitive technologies for mutation detection such as chromosomal\n                microarrays and next‐generation sequencing, the importance of mosaicism for human disease is being more fully\n                appreciated. Mosaicism can occur for any type of mutation, either at the chromosomal or DNA sequence level, and\n                while in many cases mosaicism can modify the clinical effects of a syndrome, there are many alterations that can\n                only occur in mosaic form as the mutation is lethal when present in every cell. Mosaicism can have a wide range of\n                effects, from early pregnancy loss, to organ speciﬁc pathology, to modiﬁcation of clinical syndromes. Recent\n                evidence reveals that generation of mosaic alterations is associated with aging, and our ability to detect mosaic\n                alterations sheds light on normal and pathologic changes across the lifespan. © 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.\n\nKEY WORDS: mosaicism; somatic mutation; tissue specific mutation; Pallister‐Killian syndrome\n\n             How to cite this article: Spinner NB, Conlin LK. 2014.
