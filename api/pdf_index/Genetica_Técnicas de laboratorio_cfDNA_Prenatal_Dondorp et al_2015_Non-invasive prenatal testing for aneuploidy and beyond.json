By virtue of its greater accuracy and safety with respect to prenatal screening for\ncommon autosomal aneuploidies, NIPT has the potential of helping the practice better achieve its aim of facilitating autonomous\nreproductive choices, provided that balanced pretest information and non-directive counseling are available as part of the screening\noffer. Depending on the health-care setting, different scenarios for NIPT-based screening for common autosomal aneuploidies are\npossible. The trade-offs involved in these scenarios should be assessed in light of the aim of screening, the balance of beneﬁts and\nburdens for pregnant women and their partners and considerations of cost-effectiveness and justice. With improving screening\ntechnologies and decreasing costs of sequencing and analysis, it will become possible in the near future to signiﬁcantly expand the\nscope of prenatal screening beyond common autosomal aneuploidies. Commercial providers have already begun expanding their tests\nto include sex-chromosomal abnormalities and microdeletions. However, multiple false positives may undermine the main\nachievement of NIPT in the context of prenatal screening: the signiﬁcant reduction of the invasive testing rate. This document\nargues for a cautious expansion of the scope of prenatal screening to serious congenital and childhood disorders, only following\nsound validation studies and a comprehensive evaluation of all relevant aspects. A further core message of this document is that in\ncountries where prenatal screening is offered as a public health programme, governments and public health authorities should adopt\nan active role to ensure the responsible innovation of prenatal screening on the basis of ethical principles. Crucial elements are the\nquality of the screening process as a whole (including non-laboratory aspects such as information and counseling), education of\nprofessionals, systematic evaluation of all aspects of prenatal screening, development of better evaluation tools in the light of the\naim of the practice, accountability to all stakeholders including children born from screened pregnancies and persons living with the\nconditions targeted in prenatal screening and promotion of equity of access.\nEuropean Journal of Human Genetics (2015) 23, 1438–1450; doi:10.1038/ejhg.2015.57; published online 18 March 2015\n\nINTRODUCTION                                                                               18 and 13), based on sequencing of cell-free DNA (cfDNA) in\nIn the past few years, several professional societies have issued position                 maternal plasma.1–5 The focus of these position statements was on\nstatements on non-invasive testing (NIPT) for Down syndrome                                NIPT as a promising novel approach to fetal aneuploidy screening, the\n(trisomy 21) and other common autosomal aneuploidies (trisomy                              level of evidence for the clinical validity of NIPT-based testing for\n\n1\n Department of Health, Ethics & Society, Research Schools CAPHRI and GROW, Maastricht University, Maastricht, The Netherlands; 2Li Ka Shing Knowledge Institute of\nSt Michael’s Hospital & Institute of Health Policy, Management and Evaluation, Faculty of Medicine, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada; 3Department of Pediatrics,\nObstetrics and Gynecology, Tufts University School of Medicine, Boston, MA, USA; 4Center for Human Genetics Bioscientia, Ingelheim, Germany; 5Department of Medicine,\nUniversity Freiburg Medical Center, Freiburg, Germany; 6Department of Public Health and Primary Care, Centre for Biomedical Ethics and Law, Leuven University, Belgium;\n7\n Clinical and Molecular Genetics Unit, UCL Institute of Child Health, Great Ormond Street Hospital and UCLH NHS Foundations Trusts, London, UK; 8Service of Medical Genetics,\nUniversity Hospital of Lausanne, Lausanne, Switzerland; 9Medical Genetics Unit, Ospedali Galliera, Genova, Italy; 10PHG Foundation, Cambridge, UK; 11Section Community\nGenetics, Department of Clinical Genetics and EMGO Institute for Health and Care Research, VU University Medical Center, Amsterdam, The Netherlands; 12Centre for Research\nEthics and Bioethics, Uppsala University, Uppsala, Sweden; 13Department of Clinical Ethics and Law (CELS), University of Southampton and Wessex Clinical Genetic Service,\nSouthampton, UK; 14Department of Genetics and Stanford Center for Biomedical Ethics, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA, USA; 15Clinical Institute of Medical\nGenetics, Ljubljana University Medical Centre, Ljubljana, Slovenia; 16Laboratory for Molecular Biology, Institute of Molecular Genetics and Genetic Engineering (IMGGE), University\nof Belgrade, Belgrade, Serbia; 17Deutsches Forschungszentrum für Gesundheit und Umwelt, Helmholtz Zentrum, München, Germany; 18Division Clinical Genetics, University and\nRegional Laboratories Region Skåne, Lund University Hospital, Lund, Sweden; 19Department of Clinical Genetics, Leiden University Medical Center, Leiden, The Netherlands;\n20\n  Department of Audiology, Bispebjerg Hospital/Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen, Denmark; 21Department of Clinical Genetics, The Kennedy Center, University of Copenhagen,\nCopenhagen, Denmark; 22Institute of Cellular and Molecular Medicine, ICMM, University of Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark\n*Correspondence: Dr W Dondorp, Department of Health, Ethics & Society, Research Schools CAPHRI and GROW, Maastricht University, PO Box 616, 6200 MD Maastricht,\nThe Netherlands.
