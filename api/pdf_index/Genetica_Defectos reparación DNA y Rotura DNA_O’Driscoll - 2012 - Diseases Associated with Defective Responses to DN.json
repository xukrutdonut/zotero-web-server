Examples include disorders of impaired nucleotide excision\n                 repair, DNA double-strand and single-strand break repair, as well as compromised DNA\n                 damage-induced signal transduction including phosphorylation and ubiquitination. These\n                 conditions further reinforce the importance of multiple genome stability pathways for health\n                 and development in humans. Furthermore, these conditions inform our knowledge of the\n                 biology of the mechanics of genome stability and in some cases provide potential routes to\n                 help exploit these pathways therapeutically. Here, I will review a selection of these exciting\n                 findings from the perspective of the disorders themselves, describing how they were identi-\n                 fied, how genotype informs phenotype, and how these defects contribute to our growing\n                 understanding of genome stability pathways.\n\n\n\n                     he link between DNA damage, mutagenesis,                      sense XP represents a paradigm of a DNA repair\n                 T   and malignant transformation is long estab-\n                 lished.

PNKP, its substrates and structure. (A) PNKP functions to clean up damaged termini at single-strand\n                 breaks to reconstitute the 30 -OH and 50 -phosphate (P) ends required for ligation. Some of the typical damaged\n                 termini requiring processing are shown here in red. The 30 -P, 50 -OH and phosphoglycolate termini are a\n                 consequence of ROS-induced DNA damage. The 30 -deoxyribose phosphates are produced by AP endonuclease\n                 action or by the AP lyase activity of certain DNA glycosylases. Topo I-cleavable complexes (CC) require the\n                 combined action of ubiquitin-dependent proteosomal degradation and TDP1 action to remove the covalently\n                 bound Topo I from DNA to repair the underlying strand nick.
