This\nrevolutionary study triggered the improvement of new methods that have provided\ngreat opportunities for low-cost and fast DNA sequencing. Strikingly after the\nHuman Genome Project, the time interval between each sequencing technology\nstarted decreasing while amount of scientiﬁc knowledge has continued growing\nexponentially. Considering Sanger sequencing as the ﬁrst generation, new genera-\ntions of DNA sequencing have been introduced consequently. The development of\nthe next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies has contributed to this trend\nsubstantially by reducing costs and producing massive sequencing data. Hitherto,\nfour sequencing generations have been deﬁned. Second-generation sequencing that\nis currently the most commonly used NGS technology consists of library prepara-\ntion, ampliﬁcation, and sequencing steps while in third-generation sequencing,\n\n\n\nŞ.

After the enunciation of “central dogma” for action mech-\nanism of genes by Crick (1958), we can now assess the impact of omic technologies\non description of the complexity of a functioning living cell. In conjunction with the\nHuman Genome Project (HGP), omic technologies provided us large data sets that\nare paving the way toward a comprehensive and holistic understanding of geno-\ntype–phenotype interaction in 2000s. Since genes and genome structure together\nwith their functions are essential for biological activities, elucidation of entire\ngenome sequence was the main purpose of the HGP. Before the genomic revolution,\nuse of genome-mapping approaches required probability statistics to identify the\ngene positions, followed by positional cloning to identify the underlying genes.\nTherefore, omic technologies were utilized mainly in the ﬁrst instance for genome\nsequencing, and increasing efforts involved improvements in molecular genetic\ntechnology such as gene cloning, contig construction, and DNA sequencing.\n   Even though technologies for sequencing DNA, RNA, and proteins were\navailable since 1970s (Sanger et al. 1977), revolutionary improvements in DNA-\nsequencing techniques have given rise to a large amount of DNA sequences.\nDevelopments in algorithms to analyze the vast amount of data, computer science,\nnanobiology, robotics, and information technology, as well as bioinformatics have\nhelped high-throughput (HT) DNA sequencing. Genome sequencing has become\nsynonymous with HT sequencing hereafter. The completion of a human genome\nreference sequence allowed next-generation sequencing (NGS). Since 2005, next\ngeneration of sequencing instruments that substantially reduced DNA sequencing\n\fNext-Generation Sequencing: Advantages, Disadvantages, and Future                 111\n\n\ntime and cost, and remarkably increased data-production capacity, have been intro-\nduced by commercial manufacturers. As their details will be discussed in this chap-\nter, NGS technologies rely on a set of methods for DNA template preparation,\nmassively parallel reading of sequenced millions to billions short DNAs, real-time\nimage capturing, alignment of sequences, sequence assembly, and variant detection.\nCurrent NGS technologies differ mainly on methods for clonal ampliﬁcation and\nsequencing of DNA fragments. Each has speciﬁc advantages for criteria: read\nlength, accuracy, run time, and throughput. In addition to analysis of DNA sequences,\nprogression of sequencing technologies has resulted in analysis of other biological\ncomponents such as RNA and protein, as well as how they interact in complex cel-\nlular networks. NGS technologies allowed new biological research areas—ﬁner\nanalysis of transcriptome dynamics, genome structure, genomic variation—(Soon\net al. 2013) and provided a chance to researchers to study systematically the complex\ninteractions of structure and function of biological systems and to solve important\nbiological questions which was not possible before. Expected beneﬁts from these\nunderstanding are—in a broad range—applications such as personalized medicine,\nmolecular cloning (from biotechnological point of view), breeding, and comparative\nand evolution studies. In spite of widely and routine application of HT sequencing\ntechnologies in biology and healthcare, challenges still remain for individualistic\nsequencing.\n    In this chapter, NGS technologies are reviewed and the advantages and disad-\nvantages speciﬁcally associated with each system are discussed. The chapter is\norganized as follows: we outline the historical development of DNA sequencing\nelaborating Sanger sequencing in the next section. In the consequent three sections,\nwe introduce various types of second-, third-, and fourth-generation sequencing\ntechnologies, respectively. In the sixth section, we present new technologies that are\nunder development and discuss the possible new directions of research. Finally, in\nconclusion section, we summarize the current state of sequencing technologies and\npoint to the horizon where new approaches, analyses, and tools may be needed.\n\n\n\n2   Sanger Sequencing: The First Generation\n\nFrom discovery of double helix structure of DNA (Watson and Crick 1953) till\nintroduction of the dideoxy method based on chain termination commonly known\nas “Sanger method” (Sanger et al. 1977), researchers had to cope with multifarious\ndifﬁculties in DNA sequencing. Need for short sequences, which can be noted as\nan important limitation also for today’s sequencing technologies, was one of the\nmain handicaps. Although there were some approaches developed to obtain short\nsequences, it was not yet possible to locate them in chains (Sanger 1988). Ergo,\nmost of the studies had been conducted targeting bacteriophage genomes which are\ncomparatively small thereby providing suitable experimental systems to temporar-\nily overcome sequence length limitation (Metzker 2005). Withal, absence of\n\f112                                                               Ş. Ari and M. Arikan\n\n\nrestriction enzymes was another impediment preventing substantial improvements\nin DNA-sequencing ﬁeld. Despite the studies on RNA sequencing in which ribo-\nnuclease T1 targeting G motifs could be used, there was lack of an enzyme sharing\nsimilar concept for DNA (França et al. 2002). Also, the structure of DNA that con-\nsists of only four different nucleotides can be considered as a particular difﬁculty,\nsince it complicated the separation of sequences from each other. Consequently,\nwhile the ﬁrst protein sequencing was successfully performed for insulin already in\nearly 1950s (Sanger and Tuppy 1951), the ﬁrst DNA sequences barely could be\nobtained—after almost two decades—in an exceptional study by Wu and Kaiser\nwho sequenced cohesive 3′ ends of bacteriophage lambda employing DNA poly-\nmerase for copying DNA (Wu and Kaiser 1968). Then, Sanger and Coulson intro-\nduced a new rapid approach to sequence DNA that is called “plus and minus\nmethod” to overcome explained obstacles (Sanger and Coulson 1975). This method\nwas based on activity of DNA polymerase I being able to produce a complementary\nstrand starting from a primer sequencing in presence of deoxynucleotide triphos-\nphates (dNTPs) using 32P labeling for one of them. After producing a mixture of\ndifferent-sized DNA molecules having the same 5′ end, the products were puriﬁed\nand new reaction cycles were applied. To perform these reactions, the produced\nchains were separated into eight samples with equal volume and nucleotide incor-\nporation by DNA polymerase was blocked by addition of three of dNTPs called as\n“minus” or one of the nucleotides called as “plus.” Then, gel electrophoresis was\nused for differentiation of the DNA chains and determination of the sequence con-\ntents (Hutchison 2007) Although it brought important improvements to DNA\nsequencing, plus and minus method is time consuming and has certain disadvan-\ntages like obtaining no bands for internal positions of sequences but for the begin-\nning and end of runs.\n    In 1977, Sanger and colleagues published ﬁrst DNA sequences of bacteriophage\nϕX174 using revolutionary “the dideoxy method based on chain termination” tech-\nnique that caused substantial changes in genomics ﬁeld (Sanger et al. 1977). The\nSanger method requires a mixture of four dNTPs and a dideoxynucleotide triphos-\nphates (ddNTP), with single-strand DNA and DNA polymerase. The synthesis of\ncomplementary DNA is performed by DNA polymerase using dNTPs and the\nenzyme terminates the reaction in the presence of ddNTP. The optimization of\nsequence length of nested fragments obtained through the reaction is achieved by\ntesting different ddNTP/dNTP ratios. According to the information of ddNTP that\nis employed to terminate the reaction, sequencing products are discriminated on a\ngel and results are analyzed to determine the complete DNA sequence (Metzker\n2005). In the original method, 32P molecule is utilized to label sequences and four\nlanes were needed for each sample due to usage of one type of dye for all ddNTPs.\nAlthough it was more efﬁcient compared to other methods, original Sanger method\nwas also time consuming and carrying a risk by cause of the radioisotopes used for\nlabeling (França et al. 2002). Thus, throughout the years many modiﬁcations have\nbeen introduced to this ﬁrst protocol to enhance efﬁciency and ease the procedures.\nAmong notable advances, deoxyadenosine 5′-(α-[S]thio)triphosphate incorporating\n\fNext-Generation Sequencing: Advantages, Disadvantages, and Future                113\n\n\ninto DNA sequences was proposed for labeling to increase resolution and sharpness\nof bands on autoradiography a few years later (Biggin et al. 1983). A decade after\ndevelopment of Sanger method, chemiluminescent labeling was proposed as a new\nmethod instead of radioactive isotopes bringing the advantage of sequencing PCR\nproducts (Beck et al. 1989). In this method, an oligonucleotide sequence bound with\na biotin molecule in 5′end is used as primer. Alkaline phosphatase is bound to oli-\ngonucleotide from 5′end with a streptavidin conjugate and starts a chemical reac-\ntion that causes emission of photons which are detected on a photographic ﬁlm.\nOther advantages of this approach include no requirement of cloning before\nsequencing, capability of conducting multiple reactions in one lane and performing\nsequence reading by using speciﬁc primers for each reaction. Smith et al. (1986)\ndeveloped a system based on four different ﬂorescent dyes bound to 5′ end of a\nprimer and correlated each dye with one ddNTP—ﬂuorescein isothiocyanate\n(FITCH) for A reaction, NBD aminohexanoic acid for T reaction, tetramethylrho-\ndamine isothiocyanate (TM) for G reaction, and Texas Red for C reaction. Hence,\nall reactions could be loaded to one lane as a postsequencing process and checked\nthrough gel. An alternative approach including attachment of four ﬂuorescent dyes\nto ddNTP molecules instead of sequencing primers (so all reactions could be per-\nformed in one lane) eliminated the need for application of reactions in four separate\nlanes and pooling them later for gel imaging process (Prober et al. 1987).\nDevelopment of polymerase chain reaction can be mentioned as a signiﬁcant\nadvance to simplify sample preparation (Mullis et al. 1986). Employing T7 DNA\npolymerase for ampliﬁcation and internal labeling approach is another improve-\nment that increased the resolution for obtained DNA sequences (Wiemann et al.\n1996). Alternative ﬂuorescent dyes showing differences in several features such as\nmobility in gel, ﬂuorescence intensity, and lifetime were proposed and used for bet-\nter resolution and efﬁciency (Müller et al. 1997; Flanagan et al. 1998). Moreover,\nsince the development of Sanger method, usage of slab gels was time-consuming\nstep and needed to be improved and automatized; therefore, new systems utilizing\nautomated reloading of the capillaries with polymer matrix instead of slab gels were\nalso introduced these years.\n    Automated DNA sequencing using approaches explained above was introduced\nin the middle of 1980s to make sequencing steps, such as sample preparation, elec-\ntrophoresis, data analysis, practical, and boost data-production speed. The optimi-\nzation of these devices and emergence of new techniques caused a considerable\nrise both in quality and data generation capacity for DNA sequencing. The ﬁrst\ncommercially automated DNA sequencer ABI Prism 310 was announced by PE\nBiosystems in 1996. This single capillary instrument allows automatization of all\nsteps of sequencing from introduction of ﬂorescent labeled dyes till separation of\nsequenced fragments through capillary electrophoresis using performance opti-\nmized polymer 6 (POP-6) and determination of DNA sequences by data analysis.\n400–450 bases of sequencing data can be produced in less than 1 h by rapid proto-\ncol of this instrument while it can reach over 600 bases with standard protocols\n(Watts and MacBeath 2001). Two years later, 96 capillary sequencers of GE\n\f114                                                               Ş. Ari and M. Arikan\n\n\nHealthcare (MegaBACE 1000) and PE Biosystems (ABI Prism 3700) that improved\nthe outputs strikingly entered the sequencing market. Thanks to modiﬁcations\nintroduced to injection processes, microfabricated sequencing devices allowed to\novercome certain disadvantages of ﬁrst automated instruments like background\nand resolution problems. In addition, a variety of materials used for the production\nof microchannels of these devices let accomplishing better sequencing quality and\nreduced the time (Paegel et al. 2003; Kan et al. 2004). Development of these new\ndevices not only solved efﬁciency and resolution drawbacks but also increased\nsequencing data amount tens of times higher than ﬁrst sequencing systems and\ndecreased the costs per reaction (Metzker 2005). The original Sanger method is\nwidely accepted and commonly used due to its open character to all these great\nmodiﬁcations and improvements thereby allowing completion of big genome proj-\nects in a relatively short time of the history of science while started from little\ngenomes at beginning.\n   As new methods and modiﬁcations have been developed, total throughput and\ncosts have decreased gradually for Sanger sequencing. In 1994, average 100 kb\ndata-production per person-year would result $1.5 per base net cost (Chen 1994).\nThese automated DNA sequencers were successfully employed in the HGP and\nreduced both costs and time need to complete the project. Currently, it is possible to\nproduce about 250 kb data (600–1000 bp DNA sequences) in a single run perform-\ning 384 reactions in parallel with Sanger sequencing and the average cost is about\n$0.0004 per base (Wetterstrand 2014). Total sequencing costs have decreased con-\ntinuously in correlation with new advances and applications to the original method.\n   Sanger sequencing provided remarkable opportunities to life sciences and shaped\nand improved the knowledge about nucleic acids accordingly helped better under-\nstanding of cellular mechanisms and diseases. However, this method has certain\nlimitations including data-production amount and speed, sequencing quality, obsta-\ncles in answering different applications of genomics, and labor-intensive character\nof the protocol. Discovery of new mechanisms and concepts in molecular biology\nand new horizons in almost every branch of life sciences has formed their own\nmyriad of needs for sequencing technology. At this point, new game changer for\nDNA sequencing has emerged, NGS.\n\n\n\n3     Second-Generation Sequencing\n\nIn 2000s, the concept of DNA sequencing underwent drastic changes. Particularly,\nit needs to be mentioned that shotgun sequencing approach introduced during HGP\nwhich includes random fragmentation and sequencing of DNA then utilizing com-\nputer programs for assembly of different overlapping reads caused an expansion in\nthe perceptions by forming the idea of massively parallel sequencing. All NGS sys-\ntems, without any exception, have rise on revolutionary idea of shotgun sequencing\nwhich perfectly ﬁt with the goals of HGP, development of cheaper and faster\nsequencing technologies. Consequently, just a few years after completion of HGP,\n\fNext-Generation Sequencing: Advantages, Disadvantages, and Future                115\n\n\nNGS platforms based on different approaches have been released to the market.\nSo far proposed second-generation sequencing systems are based on either\n“sequencing by synthesis” or “sequencing by ligation.”\n\n\n\n3.1    Pyrosequencing\n\nPyrosequencing that comprises “sequencing by synthesis” reaction and—unlike\nchain termination in Sanger sequencing—employs pyrophosphate (PPi) release was\ndeveloped by Ronaghi et al. (1996). After almost 10 years of introduction of differ-\nent modiﬁcations to this novel method, Rothberg and colleagues presented the ﬁrst\nNGS sequencer based on pyrosequencing approach. The three main problems of the\noriginal pyrosequencing method consisted of dATP usage by luciferase, high signal\nbackground after every cycle and difﬁculties in sequencing of GC-rich templates.\nFirst of this issues has been solved by use of dATPαS instead of dATP as this mol-\necule is a better substrate for luciferase (Ronaghi et al. 1998). In order to solve\nsignal background problem that was mostly because of the inefﬁcient removal of\ndNTPs after each sequencing cycle, apyrase (an enzyme degrades all four nucleo-\ntides) was employed (Nyrén 2007). Sequencing of GC-rich regions presented a dif-\nﬁcult problem due to secondary structure formations. Hence, addition of single-strand\nbinding protein was employed to address this difﬁculty (Ronaghi 2000). Due to its\nincreased popularity, a lot of other improvements have been proposed to efﬁciency,\nthroughput, and practicality. Easy use of double strand DNA as sequencing tem-\nplate, glycine betaine for increasing the temperature of sequencing reaction to 37 °C\nthus obtaining better enzyme performances, development of sepharose bead/\nvacuum protocol to increase robustness of the system and make it possible to pre-\npare 96 samples in a short time can be mentioned among these important\nimprovements (Novais and Thorstenson 2011).\n   In 2005, Rothberg and colleagues developed the ﬁrst commercial NGS instru-\nment utilizing massively parallel pyrosequencing. As most of the NGS technologies\ndoes, pyrosequencing involves sequencing of a DNA strand during the sythesis of\ncomplementary strand by DNA polymerase. By usage of a surface containing nano-\nmeter size wells (called PicoTiter Plate, PTP), each DNA fragment is sequenced in\none well. The library preparation step of this method starts with fragmentation of\nDNA sample or production of the amplicons with suitable sizes. Addition of adapter\nand barcode sequences is the next basic step of library construction. Then, emulsion\nPCR (emPCR) approach that includes generation of a water-in-oil emulsion and\nthen clonal ampliﬁcation of each DNA molecule using a water droplet as a microre-\nactor environment is employed for ampliﬁcation of tagged DNA sequences. After\nthat, the barcoded and clonally ampliﬁed sequences are used for sequencing proce-\ndure which comprises addition of four nucleotides, one for each cycle, to growing\ntemplate DNA and recording signal proﬁle obtained from sequencing surface using\na charge coupled device (CCD) camera. After addition of matching nucleotide\nby DNA polymerase, PPi that is substrate of ATP sulfurylase when adenosine\n\f116                                                             Ş. Ari and M. Arikan\n\n\n5′ phosphosulfate exists in the environment. Thus, PPi is converted to ATP by ATP\nsulfurylase and luciferase uses this ATP to produce oxyluciferin from luciferin\nwhich causes production of light. Between each cycle, apyrase degrades nucleotides\nand ATP remained in the environment. In every cycle, CCD camera detects signals\nfrom spots on PTP which shows position of unique DNA fragments and recorded\nimages are used for base calling process which includes quantitative correlation of\nlight signals with speciﬁc order of added nucleotides and determine nucleotide con-\ntent of every DNA fragment.\n    454, the ﬁrst NGS platform, was developed and put on the market by Roche in\n2005 and after 3 years, the company presented GS FLX Titanium series. 454\nsequencing platform can produce 400 Mb per run with an average 400 bp read\nlength. In 2011, the GS FLX was upgraded to FLX+ which is able to reach up to\n1000 bp read length and 700 Mb throughput per run which takes 23 h in this system.\nIn 2010, to provide a benchtop sequencer, Roche introduced GS Junior platform\nwhich yields approximately 40 Mb per run. GS FLX and GS Junior platforms are\nsuitable for a wide range of applications including whole genome (for small\ngenomes, bacteria, virus, etc.), exome, transcriptome, amplicon sequencing,\nsequence capture, or metagenomics. While sequencing accuracy for FLX+ platform\nis reported as 99.997 % at 15× coverage, one of the well-known problems of this\nplatform is high sequencing error rate in homopolymeric regions especially when it\nis consisted of equal or more than ﬁve base repeats. This phenomenon is caused by\nbasic mechanism of the method in which incorporation of more than one nucleotide\nin one sequencing cycle is possible. Since addition of one type of nucleotide only\nallows prevention of incorporation by other nucleotides, it is quite possible that\nwhen there is repeat region in the template fragment, more than one nucleotide can\nbe incorporated by DNA polymerase. In perfect conditions, the intensity of light\nobserved would be expected to rise due to number of incorporated nucleotides.\nHowever, total signal density and its correlation with added nucleotides may be\nmisinterpreted by the analysis system due to noise background. Another disadvan-\ntage of this method is time-consuming sample preparation protocols which include\nemPCR. On the other hand, the long read length advantage of this platform makes\nit a good candidate for applications like amplicon sequencing or de novo sequenc-\ning of small genomes while whole genome sequencing of complex genomes such as\nhuman genome requires longer time and higher costs. Roche Diagnostics\nCorporation announced shutting down 454 updates and gradually ﬁnish the produc-\ntion of reagents of 454 platforms.\n\n\n\n3.2   Sequencing by Reversible Terminator Chemistry\n\nCoupling capillary electrophoresis with ddNTPs labeled by four different ﬂuores-\ncent dyes vastly facilitated DNA-sequencing procedures and hastened later improve-\nments (Luckey et al. 1990). However, as a result of its nature, the limitations of\nsequencing technology based on dye terminators have become more noticeable in\n\fNext-Generation Sequencing: Advantages, Disadvantages, and Future                117\n\n\nlarge scale sequencing studies since to increase output of sequencing runs, one\nshould increase the number of capillary tubes which prevents establishment of high-\nthroughput sequencing systems (Chen 2014). For that reason, a variety of modiﬁca-\ntions for dye terminators has been exploited to allow design of HT platforms. The\nidea of employing reversible dye terminators in DNA sequencing to widen boundar-\nies presented by Sanger sequencing initially was raised by researchers of Columbia\nUniversity (Li et al. 2003). The development and usage of ﬁrst nucleotide analogue\ndUTP analogue (dUTP-PC-BODIPY 5) in sequencing reaction was yielded a highly\nefﬁcient incorporation and satisfying ﬂuorescence signal. Moreover, cleavage of\nﬂuorescent dye was performed successfully and signal background noise was\nreduced notably. After obtaining successful results, it was concluded that four\nnucleotide analogues tagged with different ﬂuorescent dyes can be used to conduct\nefﬁcient massive sequencing by synthesis. Consequently, several reversible dye ter-\nminators have been introduced each of which carries speciﬁc advantages and limita-\ntions owing to its interaction with DNA polymerase and efﬁciency of incorporation\nand cleavage reactions (Wu et al. 2007; Bentley et al. 2008; Pushkarev et al. 2009;\nLitosh et al. 2011; Gardner et al. 2012). Reversible dye terminators developed so\nfar, can be classiﬁed into two main classes—blocked and unblocked terminators—\naccording to binding region of blocking chemical group. Reversible terminators can\nbe formed by either attaching a chemical group to ﬁve carbon (pentose) sugar and\nlinker region between base and ﬂuorescent dye (blocked) or to the base together\nwith ﬂuorescent dye (unblocked) and cleaved after incorporation of nucleotide dur-\ning chain elongation. Comparing different types, blocked reversible terminators\nshow higher performance in termination process while unblocked ones are more\nefﬁcient for sequence elongation being a better substrate for DNA polymerase with\nabsence of any scar after cleavage of blocking group (Chen et al. 2013). Blocked\nreversible terminators are employed in second-generation sequencing systems\nwhereas unblocked reversible terminators are developed for third-generation\nsequencing systems. For example, Illumina Solexa, a second-generation sequenc-\ning platform using reversible terminator chemistry, developed that type terminator\n3′-O-azidomethy to utilize for DNA sequencing (Bentley et al. 2008). On the other\nhand, Helicos Biosciences Corporation developed an unblocked terminator named\n“virtual terminator” for its third-generation sequencing platform (Bowers et al.\n2009). The cleavage of the unblocked reversible terminators can be accomplished\nusing chemical treatments or UV (Pushkarev et al. 2009; Litosh et al. 2011).\n    General mechanism of reversible terminator chemistry-based sequencing tech-\nnology consists of three main steps: library preparation, clonal ampliﬁcation, and\nsequencing by synthesis. The procedures start with construction of library including\nDNA fragments with suitable sizes and tagging each fragment by adapter and index\nsequences. Clonal ampliﬁcation is performed on a solid surface where primer\nsequences that are complementary to adapter sequences are immobilized to create\nclusters representing each unique DNA fragment and provide sufﬁcient signal for\nduring imaging process. Sequencing step involves nucleotide addition by DNA\npolymerase, washing away unincorporated nucleotides, signal detection, removal of\nﬂuorescent and terminator groups, and washing away all remnants. DNA polymerase\n\f118                                                               Ş. Ari and M. Arikan\n\n\nadds one of four nucleotides labeled with different ﬂuorescent dyes and containing\na 3′ blocking group to growing DNA chain. Next, the unincorporated nucleotides\nare washed away. After signal detection by ﬂuorescent imaging, 3′ blocking group\nand ﬂuorescent dye is cleaved from nucleotide structure thus DNA polymerase can\nadd new nucleotides in the next cycle. Another washing step is conducted to remove\nall chemical remnants that may interfere with sequencing reaction later cycles\n(Bentley et al. 2008).\n    Sequencing by reversible terminator chemistry is currently the most commonly\nused NGS technology worldwide. NGS platforms of Illumina Inc. rely on sequenc-\ning technology consisting of bridge ampliﬁcation on solid surfaces (Adessi et al.\n2000) developed by Manteia Predictive Medicine and reverse termination chemistry\nand engineered polymerases (Bennett 2004) developed by Solexa. Combining\nbridge ampliﬁcation and reversible termination technologies, Solexa team sequenced\nbacteriophage ϕX174 genome producing over 3 million bases in a single run and 1\nyear later, launched Genome Analyzer, ﬁrst NGS platform based on reverse termi-\nnation chemistry and produces 1 gigabase (Gb) data per run (Bennett et al. 2005).\nAfter acquiring Solexa, Illumina released new sequencing platforms and expanded\ndata throughput. Currently, the company offers MiSeq, NextSeq 500, HiSeq 2500\nplatforms producing 15, 120 and 1000 Gb sequencing data per run and having maxi-\nmum 2 × 300 bp, 2 × 150 bp, and 2 × 125 bp read length, respectively. Furthermore,\neach of these platforms provide solutions for different spectrum of applications\nthereby covering solutions for a variety of scientiﬁc questions.\n    The ﬂow of procedures for Illumina platforms start with conversion of DNA\nsample to fragments with acceptable sizes. Library preparation step continues with\naddition of speciﬁc adapter and index sequences of Illumina systems to each DNA\nfragment. Then, DNA fragments are loaded to a ﬂow cell containing (immobilized\nto the surface) two types of primer sequences that are complementary to adapters\nattached to the fragments in library preparation in order to amplify each fragment\nwith a reaction named “bridge ampliﬁcation.” After binding to the primers on the\nsurface, the complementary sequence is produced and template strand is removed.\nAfter that, surface attached DNA strand bends over and anneals to the closest com-\nplementary primer, a new strand is synthesized and the replication is repeated.\nConsequently, millions of clusters consisting of clonally ampliﬁed fragments are\nformed on the ﬂow cell. After removing one type of fragments, DNA polymerase,\nnucleotides containing 3′ blocking group and a ﬂourophore, and ﬁrst sequencing\nprimers are added to perform sequencing reaction. DNA polymerase adds suitable\nnucleotide to the growing chain, unincorporated nucleotides are washed away and\nusing a laser ﬂuorescent attached to the incorporated nucleotide is activated, signal\nis detected by a CCD camera. After cleavage of blocking group and removal of ﬂuo-\nrescent washing step is repeated and continue next cycle. Index sequences are read\nbetween two sequencing period. A barcode speciﬁc primer is released to the reac-\ntion and index sequence of each fragment is determined. To start second read, the\nsynthesized complementary strands are removed with denaturation and bridge\nampliﬁcation is conducted. After ampliﬁcation, opposite strands of fragments are\n\fNext-Generation Sequencing: Advantages, Disadvantages, and Future                   119\n\n\nremoved with chemical cleavage and sequencing reaction starts again binding\nreverse primer (second sequencing primer) and explained steps are followed.\n    Although it undoubtedly alleviated many problems of Sanger sequencing, revers-\nible termination chemistry has brought its speciﬁc advantages and disadvantages.\nFirst of all, this technique increased throughput in DNA sequencing while reducing\ntime spent per run drastically (Buermans and den Dunnen 2014). Today, it is pos-\nsible to obtain 1 terabase (Tb) data per day with very small amount of input sample\nusing a commercial platform based on this chemistry. The read lengths reached to\n300 bp paired-end in some Illumina platforms (MiSeq) from 25 bp single-end reads\nof ﬁrst platform produced by Solexa which can be noted as a signiﬁcant improve-\nment succeeded in one of the main disadvantages compared with FLX 454 and\nSanger sequencing. The accuracy of Illumina platforms is reported as 99.9 % and\nstandard reagents let barcoding up to 96 samples per run (Morey et al. 2013).\nAnother strong side is that this technology shows a better performance in sequenc-\ning of homopolymeric regions compared with FLX 454 and Ion Torrent platforms\nsince the method allows incorporation of one nucleotide per reaction thanks to\nblocking groups (Mardis 2013). Instead, substitution errors are more commonly\nobserved in Illumina systems due to noise background growing each sequencing\ncycle (Hutchison 2007). Also, after cleavage of blocking group, scars remained on\nnucleotide structure which eventually caused interaction with proteins and decreased\nefﬁciency of sequencing reactions (Chen et al. 2013). Another problem about\nIllumina systems was GC bias introduced in bridge ampliﬁcation step (Mardis\n2013). These limitations originated from the nature of the method have been reduced\nwith enhancements in its chemistry. Although engineering of DNA polymerase and\nrearrangement of ﬂow cell channels has provided better accuracy and cluster densi-\nties, read length limitation still stays as the main issue for reversible terminator\nchemistry-based sequencing which presents noticeable obstacles especially in de\nnovo sequencing (Chen et al. 2013).\n    Illumina platforms enable a variety of applications in both DNA and RNA\nsequencing. Whole genome, exome, targeted, and de novo sequencing can be listed\nas main DNA-sequencing applications while total RNA, mRNA, and small RNA\nsequencing are the basic applications in RNA sequencing. Methylation and ChIP\nsequencing is also among the most commonly used applications. Among the\nsequencing platforms of the company considering its output per run, HiSeq is suit-\nable for whole genome sequencing of organisms having relatively bigger genome\nsuch as human whereas NextSeq is especially promoted for exome sequencing proj-\nects. MiSeq is the benchtop sequencer of the company presenting practical applica-\ntions of different ﬁelds in which relatively smaller data output is required. It is also\npreferable platform for de novo sequencing of small genomes such as bacterial or\nviral genomes since it provides longest read lengths. Putting all together, while\nIllumina technology has its own advantages and disadvantages explained above,\nplatforms cover almost every ﬁeld in genomics and present different alternatives to\naddress questions of scientiﬁc studies.\n\f120                                                              Ş. Ari and M. Arikan\n\n\n3.3   Sequencing by Ligation\n\nSequencing by ligation utilizes the enzyme DNA ligase to determine nucleotide\nsequence of target DNA whereas sequencing technologies explained so far employ\nDNA polymerase. The concept of this method ﬁrstly demonstrated by resequencing\nof a strain of Escherichia coli wherein the execution of base calls with 10−6 error\nrate was succeeded thus brought out a new, inexpensive, and accurate sequencing\ntechnology (Shendure et al. 2005). Also known as polony sequencing, this technol-\nogy employs mate paired library construction by tagging DNA fragments, ampliﬁ-\ncation by emPCR on bead surface to construct “polonies,” immobilization in a\npolyacrylamide gel on a microscope glass, sequencing of immobilized short tagged\nDNA fragments by ligation, and ﬂorescent imaging due to speciﬁc labels of nucleo-\ntide sequences on the sequencing surface (Porreca et al. 2006).\n   SOLiD (Sequencing by Oligonucleotide Ligation and Detection), a commercial\nsecond-generation NGS platform, based on a modiﬁed and enhanced version of\npolony sequencing was put the market in 2007 by ABI and SOLiD 5500xl was\nintroduced after 3 years. At the beginning, SOLiD platform was able to produce\nmore sequencing data then platforms provided by Illumina. However, recent\nenhancements in Illumina’s technology and release of HiSeq 2500 and HiSeq X Ten\nwhich allows to sequence much more DNA fragments in a single run terminated the\nsuperiority of SOLiD in data-production per run. Furthermore, at the beginning, the\nSOLiD had 35 bp read length thus generating 3 Gb sequencing data per run. A com-\nplete run can be ﬁnished 7–14 days depending on the chemistry. By different modi-\nﬁcations added since 2005, the read length of the sequencing by ligation-based\nplatforms reached 2 × 50 paired read lengths and 320 Gb output. A sequencing run\ncan be ﬁnished 7–14 days depending on the chemistry. The current commercial\nSOLiD platforms (5500 and 5500xl W) has up to 99.99 % accurate reads after ﬁlter-\ning due to its unique approach.\n   Library construction for sequencing by ligation bears a resemblance to the one\nfor pyrosequencing. emPCR is employed for clonal ampliﬁcation and enhanced\nbeads are immobilized on a glass surface which is possible due to a modiﬁcation\nformed at 3′ end of target DNA molecules. The sequencing reaction in SOLiD plat-\nforms depends on octamer nucleotide sequences which are used as detection probes\nand DNA ligase activity. Carrying deﬁnite two bases at 3′ end, the rest of each\noctamer sequence is consisted of degenerate bases which can bind any DNA\nsequence. According to speciﬁc combinations of two bases at 3′ end, octamer\nsequences compete to be ligated to template by DNA ligase activity. The sequence\nreaction starts with binding of universal sequencing primers to adapter sequences.\nAfter ligation of speciﬁc octamer to the template, 3 nucleotides at the 5′ end which\nare linked with a speciﬁc ﬂuorescent dye for detection of two bases annealed to\ntarget molecule are removed. Then, a new octamer sequence is added to growing\nDNA chain in the next cycle. The sequences of target DNA molecules are deter-\nmined including 3 nucleotide gaps between two base reads determined per cycle.\n\fNext-Generation Sequencing: Advantages, Disadvantages, and Future                 121\n\n\nThese gaps are ﬁlled in the next sequencing part with a shifting approach.\nFirst universal primers and synthesized DNA strand is removed by denaturation to\nstart second sequencing part. After that, second universal primers are released to the\nsurface. Second sequencing primer is designed to be composed of a nucleotide\nsequence causing one base shift in the sequencing reaction since the ﬁrst base at\nthe 3′ end of the second universal primer binds to the second base at the 5′ end of\nthe adapter sequence. Accordingly, every octamer sequence added to the growing\nchain is one base shifted. The sequencing reaction is completed in 5 parts with 5\nuniversal primers, one base shifted after ﬁrst universal primer so all bases of DNA\ntemplates are read two times with this sequencing approach which increases accu-\nracy of SOLiD sequencing systems.\n    Substitutions are the most common errors in sequencing by ligation-based appli-\ncations (Shendure and Ji 2008). The higher background error rate due to biases and\nincorporation mistakes during the ampliﬁcation step can be mentioned as another\nproblem for this method. Moreover, beads that have a mixed DNA fragments instead\nof one unique fragment decreases the quality of the reaction and causes reduction in\nﬁltered data. Also, short distance between beads can cause misreading thus create\nfalse reads and low quality bases. In addition, decrease of signal intensity which is\na common phasing effect and problems in removal of ﬂuorescent dye cause an\naccrual in error rate as the ligation cycles continue (Kircher and Kelso 2010). A new\ntechnique named wildﬁre has started to be used instead of technically challenging\nemPCR procedures and carries potential to decrease time for library preparation and\nincrease output due to efﬁcient use of sequencing cells (Stranneheim and Lundeberg\n2012). Although it provides whole genome, exome, transcriptome, methylation,\nChIP, small RNA sequencing, the SOLiD system is best suited for resequencing\nprojects demanding low error rates and transcriptome sequencing (Metzker 2010).\nOn the other hand, the data analysis problem of SOLiD platforms points to strong\nneed for new methodologies to be developed (Bao et al. 2011). Moreover, while the\naccuracy of the system is quite high, short read lengths, and obstacles in sequencing\nof palindromic sequences is still an important problem for this technology (Huang\net al. 2012).\n\n\n\n4   Third-Generation Sequencing\n\nSecond-generation sequencing technologies are currently the most commonly used\nNGS platforms. However, to reduce well-known limitations of these platforms such\nas high costs, biases resulting from library ampliﬁcation step and time-consuming\nprotocols, new methods forming “third-generation sequencing” have appeared in\nthe past years. The main difference between second and third-generation sequenc-\ning technologies is that third-generation sequencing systems are mostly based on\ndirect detection of nucleotide composition of target DNA molecules without any\nampliﬁcation step. Library preparation step is skipped, single DNA fragments\n\f122                                                               Ş. Ari and M. Arikan\n\n\ntagged with adapters are read and nucleotide incorporation is detected through\ndifferent approaches. Single molecule ﬂuorescent sequencing, single molecule real-\ntime sequencing, semiconductor sequencing, and nanopore sequencing can be listed\nas third-generation sequencing technologies.\n\n\n\n4.1   Single Molecule Fluorescent Sequencing\n\nAs reversible terminators employed for second-generation sequencing platforms\ncarry certain drawbacks explained above, in 2009, virtual terminators for third-\ngeneration sequencing technologies have been introduced (Bowers et al. 2009). The\nbasic working mechanism is similar for all reversible terminators. However, block-\ning groups and ﬂuorescent dyes to modify nucleotides show different characteristics\naccording to their structure and nucleotide binding region. The general features of\nvirtual terminators are consisted of 3′ free hydroxyl group which makes interaction\nwith DNA polymerase possible and a ﬂuorescent dye bounded to the removable\nlinker group. Virtual terminators are employed in HeliScope sequencing platform\ndeveloped by Helicos Bioscience Company in single molecule ﬂuorescent sequenc-\ning (Kumar et al. 2005; Korlach et al. 2010).\n    The fragmentation of DNA sequences to suitable lengths for sequencing plat-\nform is the ﬁrst process in the protocol of HeliScope technology. The DNA libraries\ncontaining 100–200 bp fragments should be prepared for sequencing step of\nHeliScope platform. After generation of a poly A tail at the 3′ end of each fragment\nby an enzyme called terminal transferase, prepared libraries are bound to the primer\nsequences containing only dTTP nucleotides and attached to a solid surface. To\nprevent reading poly A tails, dTTP molecules are added to the reaction with virtual\nterminators of other nucleotides in the ﬁrst step of sequencing reaction. As a result,\nany non-dTTP molecule that is encountered by DNA polymerase and added to the\ngrowing DNA chain terminates the reaction. Sequencing reaction takes place in\nconsistent with the basic principles of sequencing by reversible terminator chemis-\ntry. Every nucleotide analogue added to template DNA by polymerase enzyme\nblocks the sequencing reaction and imaging process is conducted using four CCD\ncamera and a confocal microscope after removal of ﬂuorescent dye and blocking\ngroup (Thompson and Steinmann 2010).\n    HeliScope platform removes need for complex and time-consuming protocols for\nlibrary preparation which is considered as an important handicap for second-generation\nsequencing systems. Thus, it is an advantageous alternative for especially RNA Seq\napplications which tend to be affected by PCR biases. On the other hand, the main\ndisadvantage of this platform is relative shortness of sequencing reads. A HeliScope\nplatform can produce 35 Gb data per run including 35 bp long sequences. To reduce\nhigh error rates caused by this technology, repetitive sequencing runs should be per-\nformed which increases costs per application. Helicos Biosciences ﬁled for bank-\nruptcy in 2012 but still DNA and RNA sequencing services are provided by a company\ncalled SeqLL. Despite its advantages for some applications and technological\nimprovements, HeliScope systems could not have a broad use for sequencing.\n\fNext-Generation Sequencing: Advantages, Disadvantages, and Future              123\n\n\n4.2    Single Molecule Real-Time Sequencing\n\nSingle molecule real-time sequencing (SMRT) relies on sequencing by synthesis\napproach and real-time detection of incorporated ﬂuorescently labeled nucleotides.\nPaciﬁc Biosciences (PacBio) introduced this sequencing method in 2009 as ﬁrst\nthird-generation sequencing technique (Eid et al. 2009). Uninterrupted DNA poly-\nmerase activity and addition nucleotides labeled by different ﬂuorescent dyes is\nmonitored by an imaging system. Single molecule real-time sequencing technology\ndoes not require any library preparation step since single DNA molecules are read\nin this system (Schadt et al. 2010).\n    Although it shares sequencing by synthesis concept with some second-generation\nsequencing systems, SMRT technology differs in many aspect due to its distinct\nfeatures. At ﬁrst, DNA samples are fragmented and tagged with adapter sequences\nskipping clonal ampliﬁcation of each DNA molecule before sequencing. Tagged\nDNA molecules are directly loaded to the sequencing surface and then immobilized\nDNA polymerase adds appropriate nucleotide to template DNA. Fluorescent dye\nlinked to phosphate group is removed naturally and imaging process of single mol-\necules can be performed by use of a technology called zero mode waveguide\n(ZMW), a light focusing dense array reducing signal noise background (Hui 2014).\n    Ampliﬁcation originated biases introduced to sequencing data is not an obstacle\nfor SMRT systems. In addition, an important increase in read lengths caused nota-\nble enhancements in de novo sequencing studies since short reads bring mistake in\nthe assembly of DNA regions including repeats and GC-rich regions (Bahassi and\nStambrook 2014). On the other hand, high error rate is an undeniable limitation for\nSMRT technology. SMRT technology has 5 % error rate which especially includes\ninsertion and deletion mistakes thus causing errors in resequencing and de novo\nassembly processes (Roberts et al. 2013). Read length distribution of SMRT tech-\nnology is different then second-generation sequencing technologies since the\nmethod depends on uninterrupted activity of DNA polymerase so when DNA poly-\nmerase and template DNA separates from each other, the sequencing process ends\n(Quail et al. 2012). PacBio platforms are able to detect methylation status or RNA\nsplicing pattern without any chemical treatment (Song et al. 2012). Because of this\nreason, it enables researchers to conduct experiments in a variety of ﬁelds without\nintroducing any intermediate stage.
