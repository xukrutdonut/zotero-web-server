It can affect\n                                          normal motor development and cause signiﬁcant motor disability. The treatment of\n                                          pediatric dystonia can be very challenging as many children tend to be refractory to\n                                          standard pharmacological interventions. Pharmacological treatment remains the ﬁrst-line\n                                          approach in pediatric dystonia. However, despite the widespread use of different ani-\n                                          dystonia medications, the literature is limited to small clinical studies, case reports, and\n                                          experts’ opinions. Botulinum neurotoxin (BoNT) is a well-established treatment in adults\n                                          with focal and segmental dystonia. Despite the widespread use of BoNT in adult dystonia\n                                          the data to support its use in children is limited with the majority extrapolated from the\n                                          spasticity literature. For the last 2 decades, deep brain stimulation (DBS) has been used for\n                                          a wide variety of dystonic conditions in adults and children. DBS gained increased\n                                          popularity in the pediatric population because of the dramatic positive outcomes\n                                          reported in some forms of genetic dystonia and the subsequent consensus that DBS\n                                          is generally safe and effective. This review summarizes the available evidence supporting\n                                          the efﬁcacy and safety of pharmacological treatment, BoNT, and DBS in pediatric dystonia\n                       Edited by:\n                                          and provides practical frameworks for the adoption of these modalities.\n                     Aasef Shaikh,\n   Case Western Reserve University,\n                                          Keywords: dystonia, pediatric dystonia, deep brain stimulation, botulinum toxins, cerebral palsy, pharmacological\n                     United States\n                                          treatment for dystonia\n                        Reviewed by:\n                Aparna Wagle Shukla,\n   University of Florida, United States   INTRODUCTION\n                          Aasef Shaikh,\n   Case Western Reserve University,       Dystonia is characterized by abnormal, often repetitive movements and/or postures that are caused\n                          United States   by sustained or intermittent muscle contractions causing abnormal often repetitive movements and/\n                   *Correspondence:       or postures (1).
