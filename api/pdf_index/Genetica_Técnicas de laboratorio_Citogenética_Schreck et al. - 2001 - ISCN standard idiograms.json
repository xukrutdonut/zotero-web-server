A nomenclature has been developed to\nstandardize the identification of chromosomes and the naming of chromosome bands.\nThe system currently in use is An International System for Human Cytogenetic Nomen-\nclature (1995), referred to as “ISCN 1995.” It is the report of the standing committee on\nhuman cytogenetic nomenclature edited by Felix Mitelman. The report includes a\nchromosome band nomenclature, as well as standard idiograms, which are “diagrammatic\nrepresentations of a karyotype, which may be based on measurements of the chromo-\nsomes” (ISCN 1995). The idiograms presented here, with the permission of S. Karger\nand Cytogenetics and Cell Genetics, are drawings of G-banded chromosomes with band\nnumbers indicated. Heterochromatic regions, which contain classes of repetitive DNA\nand can show individual differences in size, are indicated by patterned areas. These\ninclude the centromeric regions of all chromosomes, the large blocks of heterochromatin\non chromosomes 1, 9, 16, and distal Yq, and the short arms of the acrocentric chromo-\nsomes 13, 14, 15, 21, and 22.\n\nIDIOGRAMS AND BAND RESOLUTIONS\nThe standard idiograms were drawn at three levels of resolution representing 400, 550,\nor 850 bands per haploid genome. The G-banded cell shown in Figure 4.2.2 is at\napproximately the 550-band level of resolution. A high-resolution cell at about the\n850-band level of resolution is shown in Figure 4.1.5A. The level of band resolution\nactually observed in any cell analyzed, which depends on the length of the chromosomes,\nshould dictate which idiogram to use for comparison and assignment of band number\n(e.g., band 21q22.2 is not visible and cannot be described in short, ∼400-band-level,\nkaryotypes).\nThe idiograms presented in Figures A.4B.1 to A.4B.24 represent the standard ISCN 1995\nresolutions at the 400-, 550-, and 850-band levels (left to right). The representations of\nhigh-resolution chromosomes (850-band level; right) are based on “meticulous chromo-\nsome band measurements” done by Dr. Uta Francke (Francke, 1981, 1994a). Band\nnumbers (lowest at the centromere to highest at the telomere) are indicated to the left of\neach band. The line at the centromere (indentation) separates the p from the q arm. The\nFrancke idiograms also indicate differences in staining intensities among the G-bands.\nThe idiograms included as Figures A.4B.1 to A.4B.24 are available in digitized format.\nThe standard 400-, 550-, and 850-band idiograms have been redrawn and digitized by Dr.\nDavid Adler (University of Washington, Seattle) and are available on the Internet using\ngopher at or World Wide Web (WWW) http://www.pathology.washington.edu/cytopages.\nThe high-resolution idiograms from Uta Francke have also been digitized and are\navailable through S. Karger (Francke, 1994b). Availability of digitized versions of the\nchromosome idiograms facilitates the manipulation of these diagrams (using Adobe\nIllustrator or other appropriate programs) to create representations of rearranged chromo-\nsomes. An example of such manipulation is shown in Figure A.4B.25, which depicts the\ni(15p) seen in Figures 4.2.1, 4.2.6B, 4.2.7, and 4.2.8 with a 550-band-level idiogram.\n\n\n\n                                                                                             Chromosome\n                                                                                             Karyotyping and\n                                                                                             Idiograms\n\nContributed by Rhona R.

Supplement 18\n\f                  CHROMOSOME BAND NOMENCLATURE\n                  ISCN 1995 also includes the following detailed instructions for the naming of individual\n                  chromosome bands, reprinted by permission of S. Karger (numbers correspond to ISCN\n                  1995 section designations and are included for reference).\n\n                  2.3.1 Identification and Definition of Chromosome Landmarks, Bands, and\n                  Regions\n                  Each chromosome in the human somatic cell complement is considered to consist of a\n                  continuous series of bands, with no unbanded areas. As defined earlier, a band is a part\n                  of a chromosome clearly distinguishable from adjacent parts by virtue of its lighter or\n                  darker staining intensity. The bands are allocated to various regions along the chromosome\n                  arms, and the regions are delimited by specific landmarks. These are defined as\n                  consistent and distinct morphologic features important in identifying chromosomes.\n                  Landmarks include the ends of the chromosome arms, the centromere, and certain bands.\n                  The bands and the regions are numbered from the centromere outward. A region is defined\n                  as any area of a chromosome lying between two adjacent landmarks.\n\n                  2.3.2 Designation of Regions and Bands\n                  Regions and bands are numbered consecutively from the centromere outward along each\n                  chromosome arm. The symbols p and q are used to designate, respectively, the short and\n                  long arms of each chromosome. The centromere (cen) itself is designated 10; the part\n                  facing the short arm is p10, the part facing the long arm is q10. Thus, the two regions\n                  adjacent to the centromere are labeled as 1 in each arm; the next, more distal regions as\n                  2, and so on. A band used as a landmark is considered as belonging entirely to the region\n                  distal to the landmark and is accorded the band number of 1 in that region.\n                  In designating a particular band, four items are required: (1) the chromosome number, (2)\n                  the arm symbol, (3) the region number, and (4) the band number within that region. These\n                  items are given in order without spacing or punctuation. For example, 1p33 indicates\n                  chromosome 1, short arm, region 3, band 3.\n\n                  Subdivision of an Existing Landmark or Band\n                  Whenever an existing band is subdivided, a decimal point is placed after the original band\n                  designation and is followed by the number assigned to each sub-band. The sub-bands\n                  are numbered sequentially from the centromere outward. For example, if the original band\n                  1p31 is subdivided into three equal or unequal sub-bands, the sub-bands are labeled\n                  1p31.1, 1p31.2, and 1p31.3, sub-band 1p31.1 being proximal and 1p31.3 distal to the\n                  centromere. If a sub-band is subdivided, additional digits, but no further punctuation, are\n                  used; e.g., sub-band 1p31.1 might be further subdivided into 1p31.11, 1p31.12, etc.\n                  Although in principle a band can be subdivided into any number of new bands at any one\n                  stage, a band is usually subdivided into three sub-bands.\n\n                  IDIOGRAM FIGURES\n                  The standard ISCN 1995 idiograms for G-banding patterns for normal human chromo-\n                  somes at three different levels of resolution are shown on the following pages. The left\n                  chromosome in each group represents a haploid karyotype of ∼400 bands and the central\n                  ideogram is at the 550-band level. These ideograms correspond to the ISCN (1981)\n                  nomenclature. The location and width of bands are not based on any measurements. The\n                  dark G-bands correspond to bright Q-bands, with the exception of the variable regions.\nISCN Standard     The numbering of R-banded chromosomes is exactly the same, with a reversal of light\n    Idiograms\n\n     A.4B.2\n  Supplement 18                                                                 Current Protocols in Human Genetics\n\fand dark bands. The 850-band ideogram (right) replaces the ISCN (1981) version. While\nthe band numbers are exactly the same, the relative widths of euchromatic bands are based\non measurements and the staining intensities reflect GTG bands (Francke, 1981). The\nideogram of the Y chromosome has undergone a revision suggested by observations of\nMagenis and Barton (1987). While the number of bands on the euchromatic portion of\nthe long arm has been expanded, the designations for light versus dark bands have been\nmaintained.\n\n\n\n\n
