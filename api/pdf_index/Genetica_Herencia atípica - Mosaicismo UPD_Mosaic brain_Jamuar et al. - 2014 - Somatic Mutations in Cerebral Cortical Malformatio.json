We validated candidate mutations with the use of Sanger sequencing and, for\n       variants present at unequal read depths, subcloning followed by colony sequencing.\n       RESULTS\n       Validated, causal mutations were found in 27 persons (17%; range, 10 to 30% for each\n       phenotype). Mutations were somatic in 8 of the 27 (30%), predominantly in persons\n       with the double-cortex syndrome (in whom we found mutations in DCX and LIS1), per-\n       sons with periventricular nodular heterotopia (FLNA), and persons with pachygyria\n       (TUBB2B). Of the somatic mutations we detected, 5 (63%) were undetectable with the\n       use of traditional Sanger sequencing but were validated through subcloning and subse-\n       quent sequencing of the subcloned DNA. We found potentially causal mutations in the\n       candidate genes DYNC1H1, KIF5C, and other kinesin genes in persons with pachygyria.\n       CONCLUSIONS\n       Targeted sequencing was found to be useful for detecting somatic mutations in\n       patients with brain malformations. High-coverage sequencing panels provide an\n       important complement to whole-exome and whole-genome sequencing in the\n       evaluation of somatic mutations in neuropsychiatric disease.
