It has long been established that imprinted genes\n                                  have major effects on development and placental biology before birth. More recently, it has\n                                  become evident that imprinted genes also have important roles after birth. In this Review,\n                                  I bring together studies of the effects of imprinted genes from the prenatal period onwards.\n                                  Recent work on postnatal stages shows that imprinted genes influence an extraordinarily\n                                  wide-ranging array of biological processes, the effects of which extend into adulthood, and\n                                  play important parts in common diseases that range from obesity to psychiatric disorders.\n\n\nPronuclear\n                                 Genomic imprinting was first recognized in mammals                been found in humans (see the Catalogue of Parent of\nPertaining to the pronucleus     nearly 30 years ago when pronuclear transplantation               Origin Effects).

The idea behind the kinship theory is that mothers can bear and raise offspring from multiple fathers; whereas\n                               all the offspring from one female are equally related to their mother, each father is only related to a subset of these\n                               offspring. It is postulated that this difference in relatedness gives rise to different interests of paternal and maternal\n                               genomes in the offspring. Hence, for optimal fitness for the father, it is advantageous for paternal genes in the fetus or\n                               infant to maximize acquisition of maternal resources, regardless of any detrimental effect to the mother or to other\n                               siblings. This is to ensure larger sized offspring, which will have a better chance of surviving to reproduce. By contrast,\n                               for optimal fitness for the mother, it is advantageous for maternal genes in the fetus or infant to be sparing in demands for\n                               maternal resources, so that the mother has a better chance of continuing to bear further offspring. This theory accords\n                               with the finding that many paternally expressed genes enhance growth, whereas many maternally expressed genes\n                               repress growth, and this may apply to adult phenotypes such as maternal care and social behaviour130.\n                               Coadaptation theory\n                               The coadaptation theory proposes that imprinted genes act coadaptively to optimize fetal development as well as\n                               maternal provisioning and nurturing12. The coadaptation theory is relevant to a subset of mainly paternally expressed\n                               genes that are expressed in both the placenta and the hypothalamus region of the brain. During mammalian\n                               development, a complex set of interactions occurs between the fetus, the placenta and the mother’s hypothalamus that\n                               influences fetal growth and brain development, the provision of maternal resources at both prenatal and postnatal\n                               stages, and postnatal maternal care. Regulation of these functions by genomic imprinting is likely to be due to parent–\n                               infant coadaptation through selection for co‑expression of genes in the placenta and the mother’s hypothalamus.\n                               Paternally expressed 3 (Peg3) is a key example of an imprinted gene in which this hypothesis may apply12.\n\n\n\n\n                                 This Review brings together studies that reveal com-             use of tissue-specific promoters and the loss of a repressive\n                              mon detrimental effects of abnormal imprinted gene                  chromatin mark on the paternal allele in the brain17.
