Claes and Kim De Leeneer\n\n\nAbstract\nIn this chapter, we focus on issues related to the application of next-generation sequencing (NGS) strategies\nfor the analysis of genes with pseudogenes in a clinical setting. Hereby, target enrichment and mapping\nstrategies are crucial factors to avoid “contaminating” pseudogene sequences, which are characterized by\nhigher mutation rates than their functional parental genes. For the target enrichment strategies, we describe\nadvantages and disadvantages of PCR- and capture-based enrichment methodologies. For the mapping\nstrategies, we discuss crucial parameters that need to be considered to accurately distinguish sequences of\nfunctional genes from pseudogenic sequences. Finally, we discuss some concrete examples of genes with\nknown pseudogenes and associated with Mendelian disorders that were analyzed by NGS on various plat-\nforms and starting from different library preparations.\n\n     Key words Molecular diagnostics, Next-generation sequencing (NGS), Target enrichment in NGS,\n     Data analysis in NGS, Pseudogenes of genes associated with monogenic disorders\n\n\n\n1    Introduction\n\n                                 Pseudogenes are “fossil” copies of functional genes that have lost\n                                 their potential as DNA templates for functional protein products.\n                                 Multiple genome-wide studies of pseudogenes have focused on the\n                                 identification of their chromosomal coordinates and on their anno-\n                                 tation on the basis of diverse computational approaches (cfr.\n                                 Chapter 3). Such approaches have been recently consolidated into\n                                 an integrated consensus platform, the ENCyclopedia Of DNA\n                                 Elements (ENCODE). Within the ENCODE Consortium,\n                                 GENCODE specifically aimed to accurately annotate all protein-\n                                 coding genes, pseudogenes, and noncoding transcribed loci in the\n                                 human genome (http://www.gencodegenes.org/data.html).\n                                 GENCODE estimated that the entire human genome contains\n                                 approximately 14,112 pseudogenes [1]. For 9,368 (86 %) pseudo-\n                                 genes, the functional paralog could be identified. In total, 3,391\n                                 “parent genes” were identified.

All (G)ENCODE data are also incorporated in the\n                     UCSC genome browser. Furthermore, the human pseudogenes\n                     and their cognate genes can be retrieved from Ensembl, using\n                     BioMart [5].\n                          Over the past 20–30 years, DNA sequencing by the Sanger\n                     method has been regarded as the gold standard for the identifica-\n                     tion of mutations to support a genetic disease diagnosis [6]. As\n                     most inherited disorders exhibit genetic and clinical heterogeneity,\n                     it often takes a long time to obtain the right molecular diagnosis by\n                     stepwise sequencing the probable causative genes with consequent\n                     high cost and anxiety for the patient’s family. However, the fast\n                     improvement of sequencing technologies in the post human\n                     genome project era has recently brought to the development of\n                     large scale sequencing, which has been defined as Massive Parallel\n                     Sequencing (MPS) or Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS). NGS\n                     allows for sequencing of a group of target genes simultaneously\n                     (targeted sequencing), of all protein coding regions of the human\n                     genome (exome sequencing—protein coding regions account for\n                     1 % only of the human genome, but they harbor 85 % of the\n                     disease-causing mutations [7]), or even the whole human genome\n                     (whole-genome sequencing) in a cost-efficient and time-efficient\n                     manner. NGS offers a way to detect mutations in many different\n                     genes simultaneously through its ability to generate deep coverage\n                     of the target sequences. Therefore, this technology is on the verge\n                     of being broadly used in clinical laboratories.\n                          NGS consists of several steps. First, an enrichment of the target\n                     region is required. This can be performed by PCR-based methods\n                     or, alternatively, by DNA capturing methods. The advantages and\n                     disadvantages of both approaches will be discussed in this chapter.\n                     Target enrichment is followed by a library preparation step and\n                     then by sequencing, imaging/recording, and data analysis [8]. The\n                     library preparation step mainly serves to attach compatible sequenc-\n                     ing adapters to the samples. Most frequently, these sequencing\n                     adapters are ligated to the target or incorporated by PCR. The\n                     protocols followed for library preparation depend on the type and\n                     number of samples analyzed and on the NGS platform used and\n                     can be very diverse, since many research groups have developed\n                     their own workflows.\n                          Nonfunctional pseudogenes are free from selection pressure,\n                     and therefore, their mutation rate is much higher than that of the\n                     functional genes from which they originate and their unintended\n                     detection can be misleading. Target enrichment strategies and data\n                     analysis are both crucial to avoid “contamination” of pseudogene\n                     sequences in NGS, allowing reliable detection of true disease caus-\n                     ing mutations. In this chapter, we discuss the major features and\n\f          Avoiding Pseudogene Contamination in NGS Analysis of Mendelian Disorders       305\n\n                      drawbacks of different target enrichment strategies used for NGS,\n                      as far as pseudogene avoidance is concerned. Furthermore, we dis-\n                      cuss how bioinformatic filtering can be used to cope with high\n                      sequence similarities. Finally, at the end of this chapter we discuss\n                      a few examples of the application of NGS for genetic testing of\n                      inherited diseases caused by mutations in genes with known\n                      pseudogenes.\n\n\n2   Methods of Targeted Sequence Enrichment\n\n                      Enrichment is not required for whole-genome sequencing [9].\n                      However, in clinical settings it is still not economically feasible and\n                      often not relevant to sequence the 3 × 109 base pairs of the whole\n                      human genome. Therefore, it is often desirable to enrich a group\n                      of genes known to be responsible for a certain type of clinical phe-\n                      notypes, followed by NGS. Depending on the number of sequences\n                      to be analyzed, the purpose of the analysis, and the available\n                      sequencing platforms, the methods of target gene enrichment may\n                      vary greatly and can be divided in PCR-based strategies and cap-\n                      ture approaches based on hybridization.\n\n2.1 PCR-Based         PCR is very well suited for capillary electrophoresis (Sanger)\nMethods               sequencing, in which each amplicon is analyzed directly and sepa-\n                      rately. However, PCR needs to be adapted to NGS approaches,\n                      where many samples and amplicons must be run at the same time.\n                      PCR-based approaches are especially suitable in case regions of less\n                      than 100 kb target DNA need to be investigated. To generate high\n                      throughput target amplicons by PCR, multiple methods have been\n                      investigated:\n                      ●   Long-range PCR (LR-PCR) (up to 10 kb in length) followed\n                          by fragmentation of PCR products [10–12].\n                      ●   Multiplex PCR [13–15], where several pairs of primers are\n                          mixed together in order to amplify multiple regions of the\n                          genome in a single PCR tube under the same cycling\n                          conditions.\n                      ●   Generation of short PCR products (shorter than the sequenc-\n                          ing reads) and concomitant library preparation by means of the\n                          incorporation of sequencing adaptors into the PCR primers\n                          using the Fluidigm Access Array System (South San Francisco,\n                          CA) [16, 17]. This system utilizes a microfluidic chip, which\n                          contains separated minute chambers and thus solves the prob-\n                          lems of nonspecific amplification encountered in regular mul-\n                          tiplex PCR. Individual PCRs are performed in each physically\n                          partitioned space without cross interference with the others.\n                          Under this setting, the automatic preparation of 48 libraries is\n                          possible using a microfluidic device that hosts 2,304 parallel\n\f306     Kathleen B.M.

Microfluidic chip multiplex PCR can be\n                           tailored for the enrichment of a small target gene region and\n                           has the advantage that it allows to avoid purification (removal\n                           of excess of dNTPs and of primer dimers), manual pooling of\n                           the different PCR fragments, and shotgun library preparation\n                           steps (the read lengths of many instruments are much shorter\n                           than the length of PCR products, therefore cutting in smaller\n                           pieces is required for longer DNA fragments) [18].\n                       ●   Microdroplet-based multiplex PCR [19–21] allows performing\n                           multiple PCR reactions simultaneously with comparable ampli-\n                           fication efficiency. In this setup, microdroplets are loaded on a\n                           microfluidic chip, so that PCRs are compartmentalized by single\n                           primer pairs. Amplifications are carried out independently in\n                           each droplet, so that a simplex PCR is mimicked and more uni-\n                           form enrichment of the target regions can be achieved as com-\n                           pared to the conventional multiplex PCR method. Indeed, each\n                           microdroplet is a reaction well in isolation within a lipid capsule\n                           and containing a small amount of template DNA along with one\n                           primer pair and the PCR reagents (polymerase, dNTPs, and\n                           buffers). After PCR amplification, the emulsion is broken and\n                           the PCR products are recovered. This technology is commer-\n                           cialized by RainDance Technologies (Lexington, MA). Up to\n                           20,000 primer pairs and corresponding number of reactions can\n                           be supported at the same time by this machine, which allows for\n                           a relatively uniform enrichment of up to 10 Mb.\n\n2.2 Oligonucleotide    To sequence larger DNA regions (from 1 to 50 Mb of cumulative\nProbe-Based Capture    sequence), the capture method is preferred over the PCR-based\nMethods                methods. Enrichment can be performed:\n                       ●   On a solid phase, where high-density primers targeting the\n                           sequence of interest and ranging from 60 to 90 bases in length\n                           are covalently attached to a slide array.

Captured DNA is\n                           then eluted from the array for NGS library construction.\n                       ●   In solution, where primers are generated on baits.

Several primer design programs\n                                are now available for high throughput primer design for NGS\n                                project. RExPrimer [29] is an example of a primer design pro-\n                                gram that takes into account pseudogene sequences.\n                            ●   Using PCR-based enrichment methods it is difficult to detect\n                                large deletion/insertion events.\n                            ●   The manual design of PCR amplicons is feasible only up to a\n                                hundred thousand bases of target DNA, by using standard\n                                PCRs of few hundred bases or long range PCR (LR-PCR) of\n                                approximately 10 Kb.\n\n2.3.2 Oligonucleotide       Capture methods are more time and cost-efficient than PCR based\nProbe-Based Capture         enrichment for analysis of large regions.\nMethods\n\nAdvantages\n\nDisadvantages               ●   Not all genes and exons are included in exome sequencing\n                                designs for various reasons.\n                            ●   The capture efficiency is only about 70–80 % [30], partially\n                                due to the fact that exons with high GC or AT content are less\n                                efficiently hybridized and amplified [24, 31].\n                            ●   Another common hurdle shared by all capture-based enrich-\n                                ment methods is the relatively high proportion of off-target\n                                capturing and the co-capturing of targeted loci/genes with\n                                corresponding pseudogenes. At times it is difficult to retrieve\n                                only the target sequence if the regions of interest contain long\n                                stretches of highly (>90 %) homologous sequences, as in the\n                                case of pseudogenes. This is a problem that may not be resolved\n                                by the modification of the probe design and of the experimen-\n                                tal procedures and has a negative effect on the coverage and\n                                the variant calling of the target region. However, pseudogene\n                                sequences may sometimes be filtered out by stringent align-\n                                ment in post-sequencing data management.\n\n\n3     Methods for Data Analysis\n\n                            It is clear that the mapping of the reads generated by NGS\n                            machines, i.e., their alignment to a reference genome, is a crucial\n                            part in (genome) sequencing and a crucial computational chal-\n                            lenge. Numerous tools have been developed to undertake this\n                            task, as overviewed in [32]. The exact matching of DNA sequences\n                            to a genome requires the integration of the known features of the\n                            DNA sequences and those of the sequencing technology. Separating\n                            true variation from machine artifacts as a result of the high rate and\n                            context-specific nature of sequencing errors is the outstanding\n                            challenge in NGS analysis. The per-base quality scores, which convey\n\fAvoiding Pseudogene Contamination in NGS Analysis of Mendelian Disorders       309\n\n            the probability that the called base in the read is the true sequenced\n            base, co-vary with features like sequencing technology, machine\n            cycle and sequence context. Misaligned reads and inaccurate quality\n            scores result in unreliable sequences.\n                 Benchmarking of a large number of mapping tools showed\n            that none can be considered as “the best”, while each of them\n            provides different trade-offs between speed and accuracy of\n            the mapping [32]. This has implications for exome sequencing\n            in clinical settings, as recently illustrated by O’Rawe et al.\n            [33], who evaluated five variant-calling pipelines and found\n            that they converge on less than 60 % of the total variant calls.\n            Hence, starting from the same raw sequencing data, a consid-\n            erable degree of variation still exists between the pipelines\n            used. This disagreement is likely to be due not only to the\n            alignment method, but also to many other factors including\n            the post-alignment data processing, the parameterization effi-\n            cacy of the alignment method and the variant-calling algo-\n            rithm. Parameters determining the efficacy of the alignment\n            method include settings to weight similar sequences in the\n            alignment, settings to score gaps in the alignment, etc. To\n            obtain the most accurate results, it is crucial to choose the\n            combination of tools that is most suitable for the intended\n            application of the NGS.\n                 Pseudogenes are characterized by high sequence similarity\n            with their corresponding functional genes and therefore ambiva-\n            lent mapping in the analysis of NGS data cannot always be avoided.\n            Several NGS studies noticed that pseudogene sequences can com-\n            plicate the detection of genuine mutations residing in functional\n            genes because the primers/probes may bind on both the func-\n            tional genes and their pseudogenes, resulting in false positives and\n            making the molecular analysis unreliable. Indeed, the ratio between\n            the number of reads calling the reference base versus the number\n            of mismapped reads calling variants can confound the variant call-\n            ing algorithms and mismapping of reads to locations in the genome\n            other than the specific target lowers the variant quality score.\n            Exome data based on sequences from instruments generating short\n            read lengths (like SOLiD (30 bp) and Hiseq (125–150 bp)) are\n            particularly prone to ambiguous mapping during alignment with\n            the genome. However, with the continuous progress of high-\n            throughput sequencing technologies, read length is constantly\n            increasing. Copy number variant alleles from pseudogenes and\n            other structural variants may further confound the interpretation\n            of simple nucleotide variant alleles [30]. Therefore, in molecular\n            diagnostic settings it is strongly advised to recheck putative disease-\n            causing variants using Sanger sequencing on gene-specific (long-\n            range) PCR amplicons.\n                 In the current literature, analysis methods explicitly attempting\n            to identify and reassign fragments that are mapped to pseudogenes\n            are scarce. Therefore we provide here a list of features to be\n\f310   Kathleen B.M. Claes and Kim De Leeneer\n\n                     considered when choosing an alignment program to reliably dis-\n                     tinguish functional from pseudogenic sequencing reads:\n                     ●   Length of the seed part (i.e., the first few tens of base pairs of\n                         a read): due to the specifics of the NGS technologies, the seed\n                         part of a read is expected to contain less erroneous characters\n                         and is mostly used to maximize performance and accuracy. The\n                         longer the seed length, the more accurate reads can be mapped\n                         to the functional genes.\n                     ●   Base quality scores: it provides a measure on correctness of\n                         each base in the read. The base quality score is assigned by a\n                         phred-like algorithm [34, 35]. The score Q is equal to −10\n                         log10(e), where e is the probability that the base is wrong.\n                         Some tools use the quality scores to decide mismatch loca-\n                         tions. Others accept or reject the read based on the sum of the\n                         quality scores at mismatch positions.\n                     ●   Paired-end reads: most NGS instruments generate paired-end\n                         reads resulting from sequencing both ends of a DNA mole-\n                         cule. Mapping paired-end reads increases the confidence in the\n                         mapping, due to having an estimation of the distance between\n                         the two ends, and is useful for avoiding alignment artifacts to\n                         pseudogene sequences.\n                     ●   Presence of SNPs: SNPs are variations of a single nucleotide\n                         between members of the same species and are not mismatches.\n                         Therefore, the position of SNPs should be known before read\n                         mapping is performed, in order to correctly identify actual mis-\n                         match positions. Detecting SNPs in pseudogene sequences\n                         may be even more difficult because an individual sequence read\n                         may show significant alignment to multiple genomic locations,\n                         making it harder to distinguish a SNP from a base-call error.\n                         However, a SNP occurring within a repetitive sequence may be\n                         identified from overlapping reads that are anchored by unique\n                         flanking templates, except in the case that the length of the\n                         repetitive sequence is greater than the length of the read.\n                         Future (third) generation sequencing will have the potential to\n                         solve this issue by radically increasing the read lengths (to\n                         thousands of bases per read) [36].\n                     ●   Existence of indels: while mapping a sequence to a reference\n                         genome, it might be necessary to insert or delete nucleo-\n                         tides (gaps) and the complexity of choosing a gap location\n                         increases with the read length. Some tools do not allow any\n                         gaps, while others limit their locations and numbers. As a\n                         general rule, a balance needs to be found between accurate\n                         mapping versus detection of pathogenic mutations caused\n                         by deletions/insertions. This balance is also important for\n                         distinguishing deleterious indels in functional genes from\n                         pseudogenic sequences.\n\f              Avoiding Pseudogene Contamination in NGS Analysis of Mendelian Disorders     311\n\n\n4 Examples of the Application of Next-Generation Sequencing in a Medical\nContext When the Detection of Pseudogenes Needs to be Avoided\n\n                          In this paragraph we aim discussing a few NGS-based examples of\n                          molecular genetic testing of genes involved in Mendelian disorders\n                          and known to have pseudogenes.

This step generated 25 separated\n                         reference-sequence files (with much reduced data sizes) containing\n                         sequences specific to each chromosome (the 22 autosomes plus the\n                         X and Y sex chromosomes) and to chromosome 17q11.2, where\n                         NF1 is located. The algorithm then realigns all reads simultane-\n                         ously with all the newly generated reference-sequence files.\n                         Sequences mapping to highly homologous regions on different\n                         chromosomes are removed and in this way the true sequence vari-\n                         ants can be determined. This is a very time-consuming procedure,\n                         and since its publication no other references have been found in\n                         the literature using this approach.\n\f             Avoiding Pseudogene Contamination in NGS Analysis of Mendelian Disorders                313\n\n\n5   Conclusions\n\n                            It is clear that the introduction of NGS in clinical settings requires\n                            specific attention to filter pseudogene from functional gene\n                            sequences. Investigators should be aware of the possibilities of\n                            cross-amplification due to genomic similarities in the genome and\n                            pseudogene detection may explain some instances of apparent dis-\n                            ease mutations in unaffected individuals [30].\n\nReferences\n 1.
