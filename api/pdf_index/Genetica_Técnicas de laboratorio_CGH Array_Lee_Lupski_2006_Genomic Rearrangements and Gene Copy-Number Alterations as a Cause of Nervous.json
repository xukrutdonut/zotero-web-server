LCRs are often\nfound in pericentromeric and subtelomeric regions of\nhuman chromosomes (Eichler et al., 1999), but they\nmay be found in interstitial regions as well. LCRs are\nsometimes referred to as segmental duplications or du-\nplicons (Bailey et al., 2001), although the latter term can\nbe ambiguous when greater than two copies of the re-\npeated segment exist. The size, relative orientation, dis-\ntance between copies, and shared percent identities of\nthe LCRs are factors that render the genomic region sus-\nceptible to rearrangement and may influence the type of\nrearrangement which occurs.\n   Rearrangements are classified as either recurrent or\nnonrecurrent, depending on whether the same rear-\nrangement can be identified in unrelated individuals, and\ncan be either constitutional (germline) meiotic events or\nde novo somatic events confined to a subset of cells\n(Shaffer and Lupski, 2000). In general, recurrent rear-\nrangements, or those of common size and having clus-\ntered breakpoints, most frequently result from a mecha-\nnism of nonallelic homologous recombination (NAHR)\nbetween region-specific LCRs (Lupski, 1998; Stankie-\nwicz and Lupski, 2002; Figure 1).
