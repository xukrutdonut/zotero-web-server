Mutations in cohesin gene pathways are responsible for\n               human diseases, collectively referred to as cohesinopathies. In addition, both cohesin gene expression\n               dysregulation and mutations have been identiﬁed in cancer. Cohesinopathy cells are characterized by genome\n               instability (GIN) visualized by a constellation of markers such as chromosome aneuploidies, chromosome\n               aberrations, precocious sister chromatid separation, premature centromere separation, micronuclei formation,\n               and sensitivity to genotoxic drugs. The emerging picture suggests that GIN observed in cohesinopathies may\n               result from the synergistic effects of the multiple cohesin dysfunctions. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.\n\nKEY WORDS: genome instability; cohesin; Cornelia de Lange syndrome; Roberts syndrome; Warsaw Breakage syndrome\n\n     How to cite this article: Cucco F, Musio A. 2016.
