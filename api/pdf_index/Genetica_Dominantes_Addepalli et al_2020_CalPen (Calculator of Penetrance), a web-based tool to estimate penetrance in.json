Accordingly, a\n                                           mutation can be either completely (100%) penetrant in which the presence of mutation defini-\n                                           tively causes the disease or highly penetrant (there is more than 50% chance that the presence\n                                           of mutation causes the disease) or low penetrant (there is less than 50% likelihood that the\n                                           mutation causes the disease) [1]. However, in complex genetic disorders, the identified muta-\n                                           tions are often incompletely (<100%) penetrant [2]. In order to calculate penetrance for a\n                                           mutation conferring risk for a complex disease, Vassos et al [3] developed a Bayesian method,\n                                           which is currently being used worldwide. According to this method, five types of data are\n                                           needed: (i) the number of mutations identified in a patient sample, (ii) the number of patients\n                                           studied, (iii) the number of mutations identified in the control sample, (iv) the number of con-\n                                           trols studied and, (v) the general incidence of the disease under investigation in the population\n                                           from which patients and controls are sampled (lifetime morbidity risk or baseline risk). This\n                                           method involved simulation using the R statistical package to make prior distributions based\n                                           on the observed frequencies in controls and patients. From these curves, 2.5th, 50th and 97.5th\n                                           percentiles are extracted to obtain the median penetrance and its ~95% credible intervals.\n                                           However, these calculations require programming skills which are generally not familiar to\n                                           geneticists. Given these difficulties, a user-friendly web-based tool is desirable for direct deter-\n                                           mination of penetrance and its credible intervals without going through the need for program-\n                                           ming skills. If such tool is available, then it would enable calculation of penetrance for\n                                           mutations reported in a number of studies for common disorders and may eventually result in\n                                           a database that will be useful in prenatal genetic screening and genetic counselling.\n                                              Here, we used python interface to develop ‘CalPen’, a free web-based tool, that enables cal-\n                                           culation of penetrance and its ~95% credible intervals. We show that the values obtained using\n                                           CalPen were in good agreement with the reported values.

Among the different CNVs\n                                                    identified in SZ, meta-analysis resulted in identification of a specific set of 15 CNVs that are\n                                                    more likely to be replicated in a diverse set of populations [7]. Data on these 15 CNVs was\n                                                    obtained from different published reports [8–14]; (Table 2) and penetrance values were calcu-\n                                                    lated using CalPen (Fig 2C).
