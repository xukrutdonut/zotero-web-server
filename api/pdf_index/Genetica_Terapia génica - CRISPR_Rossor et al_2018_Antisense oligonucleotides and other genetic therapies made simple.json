(A) Genomic DNA has a double helix structure that depends on two antiparallel chains of\nrepeating nucleotides, which are composed of a phosphate group, a sugar called deoxyribose and one of four nitrogenous bases\n(adenine, A; cytosine, C; guanine, G; thymine, T). The storage of heritable biological information is mediated by Watson-Crick\npairing of complementary bases (A to T and C to G) through hydrogen bonding. Amino acids are coded in mRNA by sequences\nof three bases, referred to as codons. Transcripts can be read in three different frames, but the start codon dictates which frame\nis chosen. Note that mRNA contains the base uracil (U) in place of thymine, and that individual amino acids are represented here\nby the three-letter code. The addition or deletion of bases that are not multiples of three will result in a frameshift (eg, frame 1 to\nframe 2 or 3), whereby all downstream codons are ‘out of sync’ (deletion not depicted in frame 2 or 3). This eventually leads to\na premature stop codon (eg, frame 3), which, if it occurs sufficiently early in the transcript, results in its degradation by a process\nknown as nonsense-mediated decay. (B) Genes are stretches of DNA that contain information for the production of proteins. DNA\nis transcribed into a complementary molecule called premessenger RNA (pre-mRNA), which contains both protein coding (exons)\nand non-coding (introns) regions, sandwiched between 5’ and 3’ untranslated regions, which are integral to gene regulation.\nPost-transcriptional modifications to pre-mRNA such as 5’ capping, removal of introns (splicing) and polyadenylation, result in the\nproduction of mature mRNA, which serves as the template for ribosome-dependent protein production.\n\n\n\nthe translation of this ability into clinical use has been             ASOs mechanisms of action\nhampered because they are degraded by nucleases, they                  Degrading RNA\ndo not cross the cell membrane owing to their strong                   ASOs can mediate target RNA degradation by recruiting\nnegative charge and because they trigger an immune                     the enzyme RNase H (figure 2A).
