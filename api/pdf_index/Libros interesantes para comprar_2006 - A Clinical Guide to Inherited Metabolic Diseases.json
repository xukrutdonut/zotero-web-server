The\nwell-illustrated text is organized around the clinical presentation of each disease. Biochemical\nand metabolic concepts are presented in a clinically relevant context. It functions to comple-\nment more traditional textbooks which are organized biochemically. The book serves as an\nentrance to the discipline, to help non-expert physicians and advanced medical trainees to\novercome the intimidation they are accustomed to experiencing when dealing with metabolic\nproblems.\n  This new edition has been expanded to include substantially more on mitochondrial disease,\nnew imaging techniques, and new techniques for screening and diagnosis.\n\n\n\nReviews of first edition\n\n‘should be read thoroughly by any pediatric resident, genetic resident, or clinical fellow caring\nfor patients with metabolic disorders.’    am e r i ca n j o ur n a l o f m e d i ca l g e n e ti c s\n\n‘In short, this is an excellent guide to metabolic disease; it represents good value for money and,\nI suspect, will be more likely found in the owner’s pocket rather than on the shelf. It is\nrecommended not only to the ‘‘busy physician’’ and trainee, but to all those with an interest in\nmetabolic disease.’                          j o u r n a l o f i n h e r i te d m e ta b o l i c di se a se\n\n‘The writing is lucid, direct and salted with personal observations. Clarke’s teaching skills shine\nforth from each page . . . It succeeds admirably, eVectively demystifying the anxiety-provoking\nworld of inherited biochemical illness.’      c a n a d i a n m e d i c a l a ss o c i a t i o n j o u r n al\n\n‘J. T. R. Clarke has performed the amazing feat of distilling practical knowledge about the\ndiagnosis of metabolic diseases into a small, yet ultimately pragmatic 280-page clinical guide . . .\nOn the whole, I found this to be an amazing book which contains a vast amount of information\npresented in a concise, logical and well-organized fashion . . .

I have also striven to keep the book relatively small\n       in size and inexpensive, in order to make it easily accessible to trainees. However,\n       the Weld of clinical biochemical genetics is advancing rapidly, and some important\n       changes have occurred that have had to be included and which inevitably add to\n       the bulk of the book. Although the separate chapter on phenylketonuria (PKU)\n       was eliminated, it has been replaced with a more appropriate chapter on newborn\n       screening in general. This includes some discussion of tandem MS–MS (mass\n       spectrometry–mass spectrometry), probably the most important technical ad-\n       vance in this Weld since the introduction of the Guthrie test in the early 1960s. The\n       discussion of mitochondrial diseases, which crops up in virtually every chapter of\n       this edition, has been expanded. The rapidly growing role of mutation analysis in\n       the diagnosis of suspected inherited metabolic diseases has required changes\n       throughout the text. Even a superWcial treatment of the emerging role of imaging\n       techniques, especially MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) and MRS (magnetic\n       resonance spectrometry), in the diagnosis of inherited metabolic diseases has\n       required the addition of a number of new Wgures. The chapter on treatment has\n       also been up-dated. However, I have tried to stick to the approach of presenting\n       general principles, with elaboration by reference to some speciWc examples, rather\n       than trying to deal in detail with the treatment of speciWc disorders. I have also\n       added to the bibliographies at the end of each chapter, though the number of\n       publications cited is still a tiny fraction of the literature on the subjects\n       discussed.\n          I am indebted to the authors of a number of excellent texts that have appeared\n       on the subject of inherited metabolic diseases over the past few years. The\n       encyclopedic text by Scriver and colleagues, now in its eighth edition, is still\n       regarded as the ‘gold standard’ for clinician-scientists in the Weld. Other texts,\n       which are also organized biochemically, include the superb treatment of ‘organelle\n       diseases’ by Applegarth and his associates and the recently published, two-volume\n       work by Gilbert-Barness and Barness. The new edition of the clinically organized\nxiii\n\fxiv   Preface\n\n\n      text by Lyon and colleagues, on the neurology of inherited metabolic diseases in\n      children, is a particularly valuable addition to the Weld.\n         For intellectual support and stimulation during the preparation of this edition\n      of A Clinical Guide, I am again grateful to my colleagues, Rod McInnes, Annette\n      Feigenbaum, Bill Hanley, Brian Robinson, John Callahan, and Ingrid Tein, and to\n      the people who slave away in the diagnostic labs, all at the Hospital for Sick\n      Children. In addition, however, I owe a great deal to colleagues in other centers,\n      scattered throughout the world, who reviewed the Wrst edition and suggested some\n      changes that I am convinced will make this edition even better. As usual, I am\n      indebted to the large number of residents and fellows who rotated through the\n      genetic metabolic service at the Hospital, stimulating me to think clearly about the\n      clinical problems we tackled together. Debbie Renaud and Pranesh Chakraborty\n      merit special mention in this regard.\n         Many colleagues provided material for the Wgures in the book: Jim Phillips\n      provided the electron micrographs of the liver, and Venita Jay supplied the\n      electron micrographs of conjunctival epithelium and the photomicrograph of\n      muscle. The photographs of patients with carbohydrate-deWcient glycoprotein\n      syndrome (now called congenital disorders of glycosylation) and mevalonic\n      aciduria were provided by Professors Dr. Jaak Jaiken and Dr. Georg HoVmann,\n      respectively. Professor Jaiken also supplied the photograph of the isoelectric\n      focusing of plasma transferrin shown in Chapter 6. I am particularly grateful to\n      Susan Blaser, who spent hours with me, selecting the photographs and providing\n      interpretive descriptions of the neuroimaging studies reproduced here.\n         As always, Peter Silver, at Cambridge University Press, provided continuing\n      moral and technical support during the preparation of the book. And once again,\n      my wife, Cathy, provided encouragement and personal support throughout this\n      project.\n\f     Foreword\n\n\n\n     A Clinical Guide to Inherited Metabolic Diseases appears in its second edition; the\n     changes from its Wrst edition are those I expected to see; they are described by the\n     author in his Preface.\n        Dr. Clarke is both clinician and clinical scientist – as was Archibald E. Garrod,\n     founder of the concepts underlying our awareness and understanding of inherited\n     metabolic disease; these roles inform every sentence of this book. Dr. Clarke\n     knows that the ‘inborn errors of metabolism’ are here to stay, that clinicians will\n     encounter them in practice, that each inborn error is an ‘orphan’ disease and will\n     be rare in any clinician’s practice, and that its diagnosis and management\n     wherever that may be, and certainly not always next door to the center where the\n     regional expert works, will require some sharing of the distant expertise. Accord-\n     ingly, this user-friendly book is an available resource at an arm’s length, so to\n     speak.\n        Hereditary metabolic disease, with few exceptions, presents itself either at birth\n     or in early infancy and childhood. Its relative prevalence today reXects the\n     increased heritability of human disease among this age group in developed\n     societies, where improved health care of mother and child has diminished the\n     morbidity and mortality that was prevalent and so greatly shortened life expect-\n     ancy in the days when Garrod practised medicine. This is an important reason why\n     today’s clinician needs to be aware that among the thousand or so human genes\n     currently recognized to harbour at least one disease-causing/(or associated) muta-\n     tion, some 20% of them are involved in the pathogenesis of a hereditary metabolic\n     disease. This subset of genetic disease has signs and symptoms compatible with\n     rapid diagnosis, and the tools exist in our health care systems for that purpose.\n     Following diagnosis, there is treatment. The human organism has a limited\n     repertoire of responses to insult (as Dr. Clarke stated in the Preface to the Wrst\n     edition), and there is a corresponding useful repertoire of initial responses to\n     undertake before the Wner tuning can begin in the treatment of the particular\n     disease. After that, the clinician will treat not just the disease but, more import-\n     antly, the patient and the family who has the disease. One recognizes that\n     for inborn errors of metabolism there are few, if any, cures; there is usually\nxv\n\fxvi   Foreword\n\n\n      opportunity for control to restore homeostasis; there is always a great need for care\n      – the healing process that is part of adaptation to the new reality of genetic disease.\n         Dr. Clarke knows the theory behind hereditary metabolic diseases. But to\n      translate theory into practice and beneWt patients requires a special awareness and\n      knowledge. The proverb distinguishes between giving one a Wsh to eat today and\n      teaching one to Wsh for a lifetime. Dr. Clarke could himself treat your patient\n      today; better still, he is teaching you, the reader, how to do it yourself for the\n      patient’s lifetime. I congratulate Cambridge University Press on publishing a\n      second edition of the Clinical Guide. In it, the reader and user, will Wnd informa-\n      tion, knowledge and above all wisdom based on experience.\n\n                                                                       Charles R. Scriver\n                                                             Alva Professor of Human Genetics\n                                                                             McGill University\n\f    1\n\n         General principles\n\n\n\nIntroduction\n         In his 1908 address to the Royal College of Physicians of London, Sir Archibald\n         Garrod coined the expression inborn error of metabolism to describe a group of\n         disorders – alkaptonuria, benign pentosuria, albinism, and cystinuria – apparently\n         caused by point defects in the metabolism of simple intermediary metabolites, like\n         amino acids and monosaccharides. He noted that each was a life-long condition,\n         not signiWcantly aVected by treatment; that each was transmitted as a recessive\n         trait within families in a way predictable by Mendel’s laws of inheritance; and that\n         each was relatively benign. Following Følling’s discovery of phenylketonuria\n         (PKU) in 1934, the concept underwent a major change, particularly with respect\n         to its relationship with disease. PKU was shown to be caused by a recessively\n         inherited point defect in the conversion of phenylalanine to tyrosine in the liver.\n         However, unlike Garrod’s original four inborn errors of metabolism, PKU was far\n         from benign – it was associated with a particularly severe form of mental retarda-\n         tion. Moreover, although the metabolic defect was ‘inborn’ and life-long, the\n         associated mental retardation could be prevented by treatment with dietary\n         phenylalanine restriction.\n            The discovery of PKU sparked the search for other clinically signiWcant inborn\n         errors of metabolism. The number of disorders that has been attributed to\n         inherited point defects in metabolism now exceeds 500 (see Scriver et al., 2001).\n         While they are individually rare, they collectively account for a signiWcant propor-\n         tion of illness, particularly in children. They present clinically in a wide variety of\n         ways, involving virtually any organ or tissue of the body, and accurate diagnosis is\n         important both for treatment and for the prevention of disease in other family\n         members.\n            The purpose of this book is to provide a framework of principles to help\n         clinicians recognize when an illness might be caused by an inborn error of\n         metabolism. It presents a problem-oriented clinical approach to determining the\n         type of metabolic defect involved and what investigation is needed to establish a\n         speciWc diagnosis.\n\n1\n\f2        General principles\n\n\n\nSome general metabolic concepts\n         Metabolism is the sum total of all the chemical reactions constituting the continu-\n         ing process of breakdown and renewal of the tissues of the body. Enzymes play an\n         indispensable role in facilitating the process by serving as catalysts in the conver-\n         sion of one chemical (metabolite) to another, often extracting the energy required\n         for the reaction from a suitable high-energy source, such as ATP. All enzymes have\n         at least two types of physico-chemical domain: one or more substrate-binding\n         domains, and at least one catalytic domain. Mutations might aVect enzyme\n         activity by aVecting the steady-state amount of enzyme protein because of a defect\n         in enzyme production or as a result of abnormally rapid breakdown of the mutant\n         protein. Alternatively, mutations might impair the activity of the enzyme without\n         aVecting the amount of enzyme protein by speciWcally impairing the catalytic\n         properties of the protein.\n            The rapid transport of metabolites across cellular and subcellular membranes is\n         facilitated in many cases by speciWc transport proteins that function like enzymes.\n         This means that the process is susceptible to genetic mutations aVecting the\n         amount or function of the transporter in exactly the same way that mutation\n         aVects the activities of enzymes, and with similar consequences.\n            Mutations may aVect gene products in many ways. The coding sequences of\n         most structural genes are comprised of at least a few thousand nucleotides, and the\n         potential for mutation-generated variations in nucleotide sequence is vast. In the\n         same way, the eVects of mutation also vary tremendously. At one extreme, some\n         mutations may totally disrupt the production of any gene product, resulting in\n         severe disease. By contrast, other mutations might have no eVect whatsoever apart\n         from a functionally silent change in the nucleotide sequence of the gene. The\n         relationship between genotype and disease phenotype is complex. Severe muta-\n         tions, such as deletions or insertions, are generally associated with clinically severe\n         disease, and the disease phenotype among diVerent aVected individuals tends to\n         be similar. Structurally more subtle mutations, such as those resulting in single\n         amino acid substitutions, are often associated with milder disease phenotypes.\n         Moreover, the disease phenotype often varies markedly between diVerent aVected\n         individuals, even within the same family, a reminder that the expression of any\n         genetic information, including disease-causing mutations, is inXuenced by other\n         genes (gene–gene interactions) and by environmental factors (gene–environment\n         interactions).\n\n\nDisease results from point defects in metabolism\n         The signs and symptoms of disease in patients with inborn errors of metabolism\n         are the result of metabolic disturbances caused by deWciency of some catalytic or\n\f3            Disease results from point defects in metabolism\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.1   The primary consequences of inborn errors of metabolism.\n             The figure shows diagrammatically the various possible mutation-sensitive defects affecting\n             the compartmentalization and metabolism of Compound A. 1, transporter-mediated\n             movement of A from one compartment to another; 2, defect in the conversion of B to C; 3,\n             increased conversion of B to D caused by accumulation of B; 4, defect in the interaction\n             between an apoenzyme and an obligatory cofactor; 5, decreased feedback inhibition of the\n             conversion of Ain to B as a result of deficiency of C; and 6, secondary inhibition of the\n             conversion of E to F caused by accumulation of D.\n\n             transport protein. Figure 1.1 shows schematically the relationship between various\n             types of defects and their pathophysiologically and diagnostically important\n             consequences.\n\nAccumulation of substrate\n             Accumulation of the substrate of a mutant enzyme is an important cause of\n             disease in many inborn errors of metabolism, particularly those involving strictly\n             degradative processes. Some examples are shown in Table 1.1.\n                Accumulation of substrate is also diagnostically important. SpeciWc diagnosis\n             often follows quickly after identiWcation of the accumulation of metabolites\n             proximal to an enzyme defect, particularly among inborn errors of water-soluble\n             substrates. This is generally true, for example, of the amino acidopathies and\n             organic acidopathies, in which accumulation of substrate throughout the body is\n             often massive, and is reXected by changes in plasma and urine.\n                In inborn errors of metabolism involving water-insoluble substrates, such as\n             complex lipids, accumulation of the immediate substrate of the mutant enzyme is\n             also important in the pathophysiology of disease. However, accumulation of the\n             compounds is often limited to single tissues or organs, such as brain, which are\n             relatively inaccessible. Moreover, chemical isolation and identiWcation of the\n             metabolites is often cumbersome, requiring laboratory expertise that is not\n             routinely available.\n\fTable 1.1.

How-\n           ever, because the metabolism of the substrate requires the participation of a\n           number of diVerent enzymes, any of which may be deWcient as a result of\n           mutation, the demonstration of accumulation is diagnostically important only to\n           the extent that it indicates a class of disorders, not one speciWc disease. The\n           demonstration of mucopolysaccharide accumulation is important as a screening\n           test for inherited defects in mucopolysaccharide metabolism. However, the me-\n           tabolism of the individual mucopolysaccharides involves 10 or more genetically\n           distinct lysosomal enzymes, and accumulation of the same compound may occur\n           as a consequence of deWciency of any one of the enzymes. SpeciWc diagnosis in\n           these disorders requires the demonstration of the speciWc enzyme deWciency in\n           appropriate tissues, such as peripheral blood leukocytes or cultured skin Wbro-\n           blasts (see Chapter 9).\n\nAccumulation of a normally minor metabolite\n           In some disorders, the primary cause of disease is accumulation of a normally\n           minor metabolite, produced in excess by a reaction that is usually of trivial\n           metabolic importance. Cataracts in patients with untreated galactosemia occur as\n           a result of accumulation of sugar alcohol, galactitol, a normally minor metabolite\n           of galactose. In another example, accumulation of the normally minor complex\n           lipid metabolite, psychosine, in the brain of infants with Krabbe globoid cell\n           leukodystrophy excites a subacute inXammatory reaction, manifested by the\n           appearance in the brain of multinucleated giant cells, called globoid cells. It also\n           causes rapid, severe demyelination, out of proportion to the accumulation of\n           galactocerebroside, the immediate precursor of the defective enzyme, galacto-\n           cerebrosidase.\n\nDeficiency of product\n           DeWciency of the product of a speciWc reaction is another primary consequence of\n           many inherited metabolic diseases. The extent to which it contributes to disease\n           depends on the importance of the product. For example, most of the pathologic\n           consequences of defects of biosynthesis are traceable to deWciency of the product\n           of the relevant reaction – in these cases substrate accumulation plays little or no\n           role in the development of disease. Table 1.2 shows a list of some conditions in\n           which symptoms are the result of deWciency of the product of some enzymic\n           reaction or transport process.\n              Among the inborn errors of amino acid biosynthesis, the signs of disease are\n           often the combined result of substrate accumulation and product deWciency. For\n           example, in the urea cycle disorder, argininosuccinic aciduria, the defect in the\n\f6        General principles\n\n\n         conversion of argininosuccinic acid to arginine causes arginine deWciency, and\n         this, in turn, results in a deWciency of ornithine. Depletion of intramitochondrial\n         ornithine causes accumulation of carbamylphosphate and ammonia resulting\n         in marked hyperammonemic encephalopathy. The importance of arginine\n         deWciency in the pathophysiology of the encephalopathy is shown by the dramatic\n         response to therapeutic administration of a single large dose of arginine\n         (4 mmoles/kg given intravenously).\n            DeWciency of products of reactions is important in two other situations that are\n         common among the inborn errors of metabolism. One of these could be regarded\n         as the result of a ‘metabolic steal’, a term used to explain the occurrence of\n         myopathy in some patients with glycogen storage disease due to debrancher\n         enzyme deWciency. It was postulated that increased gluconeogenesis in patients\n         with the disease causes accelerated muscle protein breakdown as free amino acids\n         are diverted from protein biosynthesis to gluconeogenesis in an eVort to maintain\n         the blood glucose in the face of impaired glycogen breakdown. Another example\n         of the consequences of a metabolic steal is the occurrence of hypoglycemia in\n         patients with hereditary defects in fatty acid oxidation. The over-utilization of\n         glucose and resulting hypoglycemia are a consequence of the inability to meet\n         energy requirements by fatty acid oxidation because of deWciency of one of the\n         enzymes involved in the process.\n            Another mechanism by which a metabolic defect causes symptoms because of\n         deWciency or inaccessibility of a product might be called ‘metabolic sequestration’.\n         Transport defects caused by mutations aVecting proteins involved in carrier-\n         mediated transport often produce disease through a failure of the transfer of a\n         metabolite from one subcellular compartment to another. The HHH syndrome,\n         named for the associated hyperammonemia, hyperornithinemia, and homocitrul-\n         linemia, is caused by a defect in the transport of the amino acid, ornithine, into\n         the mitochondria. The resulting intramitochondrial ornithine deWciency causes\n         accumulation of carbamylphosphate and ammonia, ultimately causing hyperam-\n         monemic encephalopathy, in a manner similar to that causing the hyperam-\n         monemia in argininosuccinic aciduria described above.\n\nSecondary metabolic phenomena\n         Because of the close relationship between the various processes comprising inter-\n         mediary metabolism, enzyme deWciencies or transport defects inevitably have\n         eVects beyond the immediate changes in the concentrations of substrate and\n         product of any particular reaction. These secondary metabolic phenomena often\n         cause diagnostic confusion. For example, ketotic hyperglycinemia was initially\n         thought to be a primary disorder of glycine metabolism. However, subsequent\n         studies showed that glycine accumulation was actually a secondary metabolic\n\f7         Inborn errors of metabolism are inherited\n\n\n          phenomenon in patients with a primary defect of propionic acid metabolism.\n          Furthermore, the acute forms of other organic acidopathies, such as methyl-\n          malonic acidemia (see Chapter 3), were also found to be associated with marked\n          accumulation of glycine, severe ketoacidosis, and hyperammonemia, all the result\n          of secondary metabolic eVects of organic acid or organic acyl-CoA accumulation.\n          Table 1.3 lists some examples of potentially confusing secondary metabolic re-\n          sponses to point defects in metabolism.\n\n\nInborn errors of metabolism are inherited\n          Determination of the pattern of inheritance of a condition is often helpful in\n          making a diagnosis of genetic disease, and it provides the foundation for genetic\n          counselling. The most important information required for establishing the pattern\n          of inheritance is a family history covering at least three generations of relations.\n\nAutosomal recessive disorders\n          Most of the inherited metabolic diseases recognized today are inherited in the\n          same manner as Garrod’s original inborn errors of metabolism, they are: Men-\n          delian, single-gene defects, transmitted in an autosomal recessive manner. Disease\n          expression requires that an individual be homozygous for signiWcant, though not\n          necessarily the same, mutations in the same gene. In the overwhelming majority of\n          cases, homozygosity occurs as a result of inheritance of a mutant gene from each\n          parent, who are both heterozygous for the defect. Although it is theoretically\n          possible for one, or even both, of the mutations to arise in the patient as a result of\n          de novo mutation, this is so unlikely that for practical purposes it is ignored.\n          Inheritance of two copies of a mutation from one heterozygous parent may occur\n          as a result of uniparental isodisomy. However, this phenomenon is very rare.\n             Most individuals with autosomal recessive inherited metabolic diseases have no\n          family history of the disorder. However, the occurrence of a similar disorder in a\n          sibling or in a cousin raises the possibility that the condition is not only hereditary,\n          but that it is transmitted as an autosomal recessive disorder. Obtaining the\n          information may be diYcult because the occurrence of serious disease in children,\n          particularly if it is associated with mental retardation, early infant death, or\n          physical deformities, may be concealed by the family out of shame or simply\n          forgotten.\n             Consanguinity increases the likelihood that an inherited disorder is autosomal\n          recessive because it increases the probability that both parents of a child are\n          carriers of a rare recessive mutation. As a rule, the more rare it is, the more likely\n          the occurrence of an autosomal recessive condition will be aVected by inbreeding.\n          For some very rare disorders, the frequency of consanguinity of the parents of\n\fTable 1.3.
