The absence of\n      gadolinium enhancement implies integrity of the\n      blood–CNS barrier and makes an acute inflam-\n      matory lesion less likely.\n          Diffusion-weighted imaging of the spine did\n      not demonstrate an area of restricted diffusion.\n      However, the sensitivity and specificity of\n      diffusion-weighted imaging in detecting spinal\n      cord infarction are unclear. The results have a rel-\n      atively poor signal-to-noise ratio, with vulnera-\n      bility to artifact from movement, breathing, and\n      CSF flow.1\n          The prominent flow voids over the surface of\n      the spinal cord raise the possibility of a vascular\n      malformation, and require additional evaluation.\n      Dynamic gadolinium-enhanced MR angiography\n      may localize an arteriovenous shunt when con-\n      ventional MRI fails to do so.2 These images can\n      be a useful adjunct in guiding the selective inter-\n      costal artery angiography needed to confirm the\n      diagnosis of a spinal vascular malformation but\n      often may not adequately differentiate between\n      feeding arteries and draining veins.
