A, Baseline CT scan shows a suggestion of very early\nedema in the posterior aspect of the right putamen and insular cortex (arrow). B, Follow-up CT at 24 hours shows a small amount of edema in the posterior putamen\nonly. C, By 8 days this has evolved to a small petechial hemorrhagic infarction. D, Angiography (frontal view, right carotid artery injection) confirms a proximal right M1\nocclusion (arrow). E, A microcatheter is introduced (arrowheads), and clot is confirmed by hand contrast injection (arrow). Recombinant prourokinase infusion was\nbegun via microcatheter 4.8 hours after symptom onset. F, After 120 minutes, carotid artery injection shows complete clot lysis with normal distal flow.\n\n\n©1999 American Medical Association.
