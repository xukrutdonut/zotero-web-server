Thus, variant prioritization\n is an essential step in the process of rare disease diagnosis. In addition to conducting the usual\n in-silico analyses to predict variant pathogenicity (based on nucleotide/amino-acid conservation and\n the differences between the physicochemical features of the amino-acid change), three important\n concepts should be borne in mind. The first is the “mutation tolerance” of the genes in which variants\n are located. This describes the susceptibility of a given gene to any functional mutation and depends\n on the strength of purifying selection acting against it. The second is the “mutational architecture”\n of each gene. This describes the type and location of mutations previously identified in the gene,\n and their association with different phenotypes or degrees of severity. The third is the mode of\n inheritance (inherited vs. de novo) of the variants detected. Here, we discuss the importance of each\n of these concepts for variant prioritization in the diagnosis of rare diseases. Using real data, we show\n how genes, rather than variants, can be prioritized by calculating a gene-specific mutation tolerance\n score. We also illustrate the influence of mutational architecture on variant prioritization using five\n paradigmatic examples. Finally, we discuss the importance of familial variant analysis as final step in\n variant prioritization.\n\n Keywords: rare disease diagnosis; variant prioritization; mutation tolerance; mutational architecture;\n next-generation sequencing\n\n\n\n\n1. Introduction\n     The growing use of next-generation sequencing (NGS) technology in large human populations\nhas revealed that the extent of the variation in the human genome exceeds previous estimations.\nMoreover, it has been shown that the vast majority of protein-coding variation is evolutionarily recent,\nrare, and enriched for deleterious alleles, and that the rarest single nucleotide variants (SNVs) are\npopulation-specific [1]. Rare variation, therefore, likely contributes significantly to human phenotypic\nvariation and disease susceptibility, particularly in the field of rare diseases.\n     When a rare disease diagnosis using NGS analysis (focused gene panel, whole exome sequencing\n(WES) or whole genome sequencing (WGS)) is requested, there is a high likelihood that the result will\nconsist of a list of rare variants of uncertain significance. Many of these variants will prove benign.\nWhile most laboratories that perform NGS testing will provide an assessment of the pathogenicity of the\n\n\nInt. J. Mol.

Currently available informatics tools used to evaluate\npathogenicity are limited to the assessment of nucleotide conservation throughout evolution and\ndifferences in the physicochemical features of the two amino acids involved in the change (in the case\nof missense variants) [2–11]. In the case of synonymous and intronic variants, developed software can\ndetermine whether the nucleotide change disrupts a consensus sequence that is particularly important\nfor splicing (acceptor/donor sites, enhancer/silencing motifs, and branchpoints) [12,13]. Nonetheless,\nany rare variant has the potential to be pathogenic, irrespective of the predictions of bioinformatic\ntools. Conversely, many variants with predicted pathogenicity are often subsequently revealed to be\nbenign. Whenever possible, sequencing of both parents and the proband will substantially increase the\ninterpretability of any variants detected. However, when seeking a molecular diagnosis, it is essential\nto consider two additional levels of variant prioritization: the mutation tolerance and the mutational\narchitecture of each gene, both of which are intimately related. With the aid of examples created using\nreal data, this review will provide a comprehensive explanation of these two important concepts.\n\n2. Mutation Tolerance\n\n2.1. Introduction\n      To prioritize variants detected by NGS-based analysis, it is important to perform a quantitative\nassessment of the tolerance of each gene to functional genetic variation. Certain genes are much more\ntolerant to mutation than others. Experts who work with genes implicated in rare diseases are familiar\nwith the variability of these genes in controls and patients, and understand that the appearance of rare\nvariants in certain genes is not a cause for alarm, whereas in other cases, the appearance of one or\n(in the case of a recessive disease) two rare variants is highly indicative of pathogenicity.\n      It has long been known that the extent of conservation varies between genes [14]. Several studies\nof substitution-rate variation have shown that the local mutation rate varies across the mammalian\ngenome. The substitution rate is affected by the proportion of GC (since the base composition is not\nequilibrated), the site itself (CpG or non-CpG), and the mutation type (e.g., transition, transversion,\nlength variants) [15,16]. Petrovski et al. [17] developed a system to assign to each gene a score that\nmeasures intolerance to functional genetic variation, based on data extracted from 6503 whole-exome\nsequences from the NHLBI Exome Sequencing Project (ESP). They showed that genes responsible\nfor Mendelian diseases are significantly less tolerant to functional genetic variation than genes that\ndo not cause any known disease, and observed striking variation in intolerance among genes that\ncause different classes of genetic disease [17]. As mentioned above, many tools have been developed\nto attempt to prioritize variants in terms of measures of conservation at either the phylogenetic level\nor based on amino acid characteristics. However, few analogous approaches have been developed\nto prioritize the genes in which the variants are detected [18,19]. By quantifying the strength and\nconsistency of purifying selection acting against functional variation in a given gene, or the effects\nof other kinds of selection (e.g., balancing or positive selection), genes can be ranked based on their\nmutation tolerance. Thus, a gene-level score could be combined with well-established variant-level\nscores to highlight candidate causal mutations.\n\n2.2. Information That Can Be Extracted from Common and Rare Variants in Control Sample Databases to\nEvaluate Mutation Tolerance\n     For the more evolutionarily conserved genes (intolerant genes), which are subjected to\nnegative-purifying selection, it is assumed that, for common variants, the non-synonymous mutation\nrate (Kn-syn) should be lower than the synonymous mutation rate (Ksyn), which involves greater\na priori impact for new mutations. This is because if one variant is pathogenic, the probability\nthat it will be perpetuated in the population in the form of common variant decreases dramatically\nas a consequence of the negative-purifying selection acting against it. By contrast, new mutations\nfound in less conserved genes (tolerant genes) involve lesser a priori functional impact. For example,\n\fInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2018, 19, 1584                                                                        3 of 26\n\n\n\nthe analysis of data generated from the sequencing of 6500 “control” exomes as part of the ESP6500\nproject has been previously used to define the load of loss-of-function mutations per gene [20] and to\nprioritize >4000 human genes that are most intolerant to variation [21].\n       In the case of rare variants (the most important for rare disease diagnosis), in addition to gene\nconservation, we must bear in mind that the length and specific mutation rate of each gene will\ninfluence the number of variants observed per gene. This is because in the case of novel rare\nvariants, not enough time has passed to observe the effect of conservation force. Thus we cannot tell\nwhether over time a given variant will be allowed perpetuate (i.e., is neutral) or will be eliminated\n(because it is harmful). Therefore, in addition to knowing the specific mutation tolerance of each gene,\nit is important to quantify the number of rare variants in genes in population controls in order to have\na more precise estimate of the mutational load of rare variants expected for each gene. Rare variant\ndata obtained from controls can be used to estimate the variant load (and distribution) per gene.\n\n2.3. Mutation Tolerance of Genes Involved in Metabolic/Neurologic Diseases: Examples\n      To demonstrate the diversity of mutation tolerance among genes involved in rare disorders,\nwe used the common variants detected in 659 samples from individuals of European ancestry extracted\nfrom the 1000 Genomes Project for each of the 1670 genes (additional data available upon request)\nincluded in our diagnostic panels for metabolic/neurologic rare diseases (www.neuromegen.com).\nWe first regressed the number of total common exonic variants (minor allele frequency in 1000 G\n(GMAF) > 0.5%) against gene length (Figure 1A; RSE = 3.7, AdjR2 = 0.56). In this graph, the position\nof each gene is determined by two factors: (1) the specific mutation rate of the gene in question;\nand (2) the effect of conservation force on each gene (red genes exhibit more mutations than expected\nbased on their size, and blue genes exhibit fewer variants than expected based on their size). Next,\nwe plotted common functional variants (i.e., all except synonymous variants) against gene length\n(Figure 1B; RSE = 2.3, AdjR2 = 0.43). In this graph, more weight is given to evolutionary conservation\nforce, since only variants that have functional consequences are considered. Compared with Figure 1,\nthe position of most genes is unchanged, although in some cases, significant changes are observed,\nwith some genes shifting position to the opposite side of the linear regression line. For example,\nthe tolerance of TTN, SYNE2, ADGRV1, CENPF, ALMS1, ZNF469, and NEB is increased. While for\nsome genes (e.g., NEB, ALMS1), the number of common variants is less than or equal to the number\nexpected based on gene length, assessment of functional variants alone reveals a higher than expected\nmutational load, indicating that evolutionary conservation force does not exert a significant effect.\nMany of the genes for which this phenomenon was observed encode large structural proteins involved\nin muscular function (TTN, NEB, SYNE2). The opposite effect is observed for other genes (e.g., RYR1,\nRYR3, ANK3, TRIO, SPTAN1), for which the number of common variants is greater than that expected\nbased on gene length (indicative of a high mutation rate for these genes). For these genes, restriction\nof the analysis to functional variants resulted in decreased mutation tolerance, with some genes\n(e.g., RYR1) shifting position to the other side of the linear regression line, indicating a significant effect\nof evolutionary conservation force on this gene (i.e., mutation intolerance). By regressing common\nnon-synonymous variants against the total mutational load of the gene (common non-synonymous\n+ synonymous) (Figure 1C; RSE = 1.3, AdjR2 = 0.81), we should discount the specific gene mutation\nrate for each gene and focus only on the weight of conservation force. This results in shifts in the\npositions of many genes from both the mutation-tolerant and mutation-intolerant sides of the graph\nto more neutral positions. Exceptions include RYR1, for which a decrease in tolerance is observed,\nand COL6A3, PLEC, and HSPG2, which shift from a mutation-tolerant to mutation-intolerant or neutral\npositions, indicating that their previous position was attributable only to their high specific mutation\nrate. For other genes, such as TTN or ATM, shifts in position reflecting increased mutation tolerance\nare observed, indicating that their previous positions were attributable to their a priori low mutation\nrate (e.g., DST moves from a mutation-intolerant to a mutation-tolerant position).\n\f                   z-score than recessive genes (Wilcoxon test: p-value = 1.4 × 10−13) (Figure 2). Intuitively, dominant\n                   genes should be less tolerant to variation than recessive genes, since in the former case, perturbation\n                   of one allele can promote disease, while in the case of recessive genes, the second allele can\n                   compensate for the damaged allele. Purifying selection force is greater for dominant genes. We found\n                   that 50.4% of X-linked genes had the same z-score (equal to the median of all X-linked and recessive\n                   genes analyzed), which entails that 77% of X-linked genes have a z-score lower or equal to the median\nInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2018,  19, 1584\n                   of recessive genes. This makes sense since the X-linked genes in males behave as dominant since they            4 of 26\n                   are reduced to hemizygosity, so they do not have a second allele that compensates for the damaged one.\n\n\n\n\n                 Int.

J. Mol. Sci. 2018, 19, 1584                                                                                   5 of 26\n\n\n\n      We calculated the z-score for each gene to quantify mutation tolerance using a previously described\nmethod [17,21], which is based on departure from the mean common non-synonymous variant\nspectrum (functional), corrected for the total mutation burden in a given gene. The z-score was\ngenerated by regressing the total number of common (GMAF > 0.5%) non-synonymous variants\nagainst the total number of common variants (non-synonymous + synonymous) observed within\na gene, after which each gene was assigned the corresponding studentized residual as its z-score.\nA z-score of 0 indicates that the number of non-synonymous variants in a given gene is equivalent\nto the number estimated based on its total mutation burden. Genes with a negative z-score have\nfewer than the expected number of common non-synonymous variants based on the global mutational\nburden, and are thus likely to be less tolerant of functional mutations. A negative z-score is therefore\nindicative of genes subjected to strong purifying selection. Figure 1D shows the z-score calculated\nfor each of the 1670 genes from our diagnostic panels. The higher the z-score obtained for a gene,\nthe more tolerant it is to functional mutations and the lower the probability of a priori pathogenicity.\nThe lower the z-score of a given gene, the higher the a priori probability that a new mutation will be\npathogenic or related to the phenotype, although there are exceptions to this rule depending on the\ngene length, as we will show later. As it could be expected, dominant genes have a much lower z-score\nthan recessive genes (Wilcoxon test: p-value = 1.4 × 10−13 ) (Figure 2). Intuitively, dominant genes\nshould be less tolerant to variation than recessive genes, since in the former case, perturbation of one\nallele can promote disease, while in the case of recessive genes, the second allele can compensate for\nthe damaged allele. Purifying selection force is greater for dominant genes. We found that 50.4% of\nX-linked genes had the same z-score (equal to the median of all X-linked and recessive genes analyzed),\nwhich entails that 77% of X-linked genes have a z-score lower or equal to the median of recessive genes.\nThis makes sense since the X-linked genes in males behave as dominant since they are reduced to\nhemizygosity,        so they do not have a second allele that compensates for the damaged one. 6 of 27\n      Int.

The mean number of rare missense TTN variants\n(with GMAF < 0.5%) found in any individual is 0.5. The 364-exon TTN gene (OMIM 188840)\nencodes titin, the largest known human protein [22]. Titin is one of the most important sarcomeric\nproteins, and is involved in the development of cardiac and skeletal muscle, as well as in architecture,\nelasticity, and cell signaling. TTN mutations are associated with a broad spectrum of phenotypic\nseverity [23–30]. In our experience, the detection of rare missense variants in the TTN gene in patients\nwith neuromuscular disorders is relatively common, and does not necessarily indicate the involvement\nof this gene in the patient’s phenotype. In fact, most of the TTN variants recorded in ClinVar that are\nimplicated in titinopathies are truncating variants. Only some missense mutations in trans with a\ntruncating variant or isolated missense mutations located in highly specific protein codons have been\nassociated with diseases [23].\n      Mutation-intolerant genes (left side of Table 1) are not usually observed in the final dataset of\nfiltered rare variants produced by our diagnostic panels. When these genes do appear, we subject\nthem to careful analysis to evaluate the compatibility between the associated disease and the patient’s\nclinical history, since the genes will likely be implicated in the patient’s disorder. However, as described\nbelow, the length of the gene should also be considered in this evaluation.\n\fInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2018, 19, 1584                                                                               7 of 26\n\n\n\n2.4. Information Extracted from Rare Variant Spectrum for Genes Implicated in Metabolic/Neurologic Diseases:\nExamples\n     The presence of rare variants in a gene not only depends on the specific mutation tolerance of\nthe gene in question (previous section), but is also influenced by the gene’s length and its specific\nmutation rate. To illustrate this, using data from the same 659 probands analyzed in the previous\nsection, we calculated the probability of finding one rare variant in dominant or X-linked genes or two\nrare variants in recessive genes for each of the 1670 genes analyzed (Figure 3). Genes that behaved\nas both dominant and recessive were included in both groups. To this end, we used the Poisson\ndistribution, P(λ), where λ is the frequency of rare variants (GMAF < 0.5%) in each gene. Since gene\nlength influences this probability, we also grouped genes based on length. As expected, y-axis values\nincreased with increasing gene length for both groups (Figure 3A,B). It is not unusual to find two\nor more functional rare variants in recessive genes with high z-scores (i.e., mutation-tolerant genes),\nexemplified in this case by TTN (9%) and NEB (0.8%). Nonetheless, for several genes with low z-scores\n(intolerant), including RYR1, RYR3, COL6A3, and PLEC, the probabilities are in the same range (0.3%,\n0.2%,Int.\n       0.3%   and\n          J. Mol.

Furthermore, a large\npercentage of the dominant genes for which the probability of finding one variant (usually a de novo\nmutation) was lowest are implicated in epileptic encephalopathy and brain development (green).\n     In the case of recessive genes, the presence of 2 rare variants (or a homozygous rare variant)\nin GM2A, NEU1, DDHD1, and ARFGEF2 for example (in which the probability of detection by chance\nranges from ~0% to 0.001%), dramatically increases the probability that these changes are associated\nwith the patient’s phenotype, even if the patients’ clinical features do not match perfectly with the\ndisease-associated gene. The opposite occurs for TTN, NEB, and SYNE1, for which the probability of\nfinding two rare variants by chance is 9%, 0.8%, and 0.7%, respectively. However, it is important to note\nthat the probability is based not only on the conservation score of each gene but also on gene length.\nThus, despite the low z-scores of RYR1, RYR3, and PLEC, probabilities of 0.3%, 0.2%, and 0.7% were\nobtained, attributable to the length of the genes and possibly the effects of other factors influencing the\nmutation rate.\n     In the case of dominant genes, the detection of one rare variant in STX1B, GABRG2, TUBB2B,\nTUBB, TUBB1A, GRIN2D, CHD2, SCN2A, and SCN1A, all of which are implicated in epileptic\nencephalopathies or brain development and have scores ranging from ~0% to 1%, warrants careful\nattention and indicates a need to perform familial studies, since these mutations are likely de novo.\n\n2.5. Conservation Score for Nucleotide(s) Affected in the Variant and Relationship with Variant Frequency\n     Once mutation tolerance and rare mutational load are assessed for each gene, it is important\nalso to take into account a score that considers whether the specific nucleotide affected by the variant\nexhibits evidence of selective constraint throughout evolution. While a given gene may be highly\nmutation-intolerant, if the specific nucleotide that is mutated is not conserved, it is possible that\n\fInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2018, 19, 1584                                                                                    9 of 26\n\n\n\nthe variant is neutral and vice versa (i.e., in mutation-tolerant genes, if the specific nucleotide is\nhighly conserved, it is possible that the variant is harmful). There are bioinformatics tools that can\nquantitatively estimate nucleotide conservation throughout evolution [2,3].\n        The GERP (Genomic Evolutionary Rate Profiling) tool assigns a specific conservation score to each\nposition using maximum likelihood evolutionary rate estimation. As previously demonstrated [14],\nthe data obtained with our group of genes indicate that the higher the GERP value, the lower the\nvariant frequency (Figure 4A), and show that the non-synonymous-to-synonymous ratio among rare\n(<0.5%) variants (with GERP > 2) is higher (typically in the range of 1–2) than that observed for common\nvariants (range, 0.5–1.5). This suggests that 25–50% of rare non-synonymous variants are deleterious\n(and therefore subjected to purifying selection) (Figure 4B). Based on these findings, we can infer that\nthe lower the GMAF and the higher the GERP score, the greater the probability that the variant in\nquestion is implicated in a pathogenic process. This also implies that when we find, for example,\na synonymous or intronic mutation that is not described in any population database (frequency = 0)\nand has a high GERP score (>4), it is imperative to analyze this change using a program to evaluate\nregions involved in splicing, since the degree of conservation should indicate whether the nucleotide\nInt.

The same variant (type and location) could have very deleterious effects in\none gene, but not in another. Certain genes are susceptible only to truncating variants but tolerate\nmissense variants (e.g., TTN, SYNE1). Similarly, some genes (e.g., KCNQ2) are only susceptible to\nmissense gain-of-function mutations, while truncating mutations give rise to much milder phenotypes.\nSETBP1 is an example of a gene that is sensitive only to missense variants that are located in very\nspecific positions of the protein and give rise to a very severe phenotype. In the case of CDKL5, specific\nexons of the gene are mutation-insensitive, while in some genes that only tolerate mosaic mutations,\nsuch as AKT1 and GNAS, germinal mutations are lethal. Having up-to-date information on the specific\nmutational architecture of each gene allows correct prioritization of variants detected by NGS analysis,\nas illustrated below in 5 paradigmatic examples of mutations implicated in neurologic and metabolic\ndisorders. In each example, specific aspects of the mutation must be taken into account to ensure\ncorrect variant prioritization.\n\n3.1. KCNQ2: Disease Severity Depends on the Mutation Type (Truncating vs. Missense)\n     In some genes, different mutation types (truncating vs. missense) result in different degrees\nof pathological severity. Contrary to expectation, truncating mutations do not always give rise\nto the most severe phenotype, which depends on the function of the protein encoded by the\ngene. This is well exemplified by the KCNQ2 gene. Mutations in this gene, which encodes one\nof the two subunits of the voltage-gated potassium channel that mediates the neuronal M-current\n(IKM) [32], give rise to early-onset epileptic diseases, which vary considerably in their phenotypic\npresentation [33]. The M channel mediates the conduction of a slowly activating and deactivating\npotassium current, and plays a major role in setting the lower electroexcitability threshold, as well\nas the capacity of neurons to respond to synaptic input. In 1998, the first dominant mutations in this\nchannel were described, and were associated with benign familial neonatal epilepsy (BFNS) with\ngood prognosis [33–35]. In stark clinical contrast, KCNQ2 mutations were subsequently implicated\nwith early onset epileptic encephalopathy (EOEE), a much more severe and disabling disorder [36].\nPatients with KCNQ2 encephalopathy display tonic seizures two to three days after birth, have an\nelectroencephalography profile characterized by suppression-burst patterns or multifocal epileptic\nactivity, and have a poor neurological prognosis [37–39]. The presence of KCNQ2 whole-gene deletions\nin BFNS patients demonstrates that total loss of function of one allele causes only benign phenotypes.\nTherefore, haploinsufficiency cannot explain the more severe KCNQ2–EOEE phenotype. Moreover,\nall KCNQ2–EOEE mutations described to date are missense mutations, never haploinsufficiency\nmutations (which are always associated with BFNS). A possible explanation for this finding is that\nhaploinsufficiency may be physiologically reversed, as observed in BFNS patients, while alleles with\nmissense mutations can give rise to M channels that are functional but have varying voltage sensitivities\ndepending on the amino acid change in question (gain and loss of function). This finding is very\nimportant since it could lead to the development of personalized treatments for KCNQ2–EOEE.\nTherapies using antisense oligonucleotides are being developed for diseases caused by known\ndominant negative mutations. Specific inhibition of the transcription or translation of the mutated\nKCNQ2 allele could result in a loss-of-function scenario, mimicking KCNQ2 haploinsufficiency,\nwhich in turn is known to give rise to the milder BFNS phenotype. Such a strategy could therefore\npotentially convert severe EOEE to a benign neonatal epilepsy syndrome [40].\n\n3.2. SETBP1: Phenotypes Differ Markedly Depending on the Type of Mutation, the Location Thereof, and the\nPercentage of Cells Affected\n     SETBP1 provides a particularly interesting example since the phenotype produced by mutations\nin this gene depends not only on the type of mutation (truncating vs. missense) but also on the region\nin which the missense mutation is located and the percentage of cells in which it is found (mosaic vs.\ngermline mutations).\n\fInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2018, 19, 1584                                                                       11 of 26\n\n\n\n        Haploinsufficiency mutations in this gene result in intellectual disability (ID) of variable severity\nassociated with difficulties in verbal communication [41,42]. Although the spectrum of intellectual\nimpairment ranges from normal to severe, mild ID is observed in most cases. Several individuals\nwith disruptive mutations have good receptive language skills but completely lack expressive\nspeech [20,43,44]. Other features include impaired fine motor skills, subtle dysmorphism, hyperactivity,\nand autistic traits [20,42].\n        However, missense de novo mutations in three specific amino acids clustered in a highly conserved\n11-bp exonic region (Figure 5) that includes residues 868 to 871 result in a very severe disorder known\nas Schinzel–Giedion syndrome (SGS), the first dominant disorder for which the genetic basis was\nidentified by whole-exome sequencing [45]. It is characterized by severe mental retardation, persistent\nfeeding problems, severe forms of epilepsy, distinctive facial features, and various congenital organ\ndefects, blindness, deafness, and increased risk of malignancy.
