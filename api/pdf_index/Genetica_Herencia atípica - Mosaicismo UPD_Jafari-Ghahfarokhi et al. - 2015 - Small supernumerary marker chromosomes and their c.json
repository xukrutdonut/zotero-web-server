It is an\n                               additional chromosome smaller than one chromosome most often lacking a distinct banding pattern and\n                               is rarely identifiable by conventional banding cytogenetic analysis. The origin and composition of an sSMC\n                               is recognizable by molecular cytogenetic analysis. These sSMCs are seen in different shapes, including the\n                               ring, centric minute, and inverted duplication shapes. The effects of sSMCs on the phenotype depend on\n                               factors such as size, genetic content, and the level of the mosaicism. The presence of an sSMC causes partial\n                               tris‑ or tetrasomy, and 70% of the sSMC carriers are clinically normal, while 30% are abnormal in some way.\n                               In 70% of the cases the sSMC is de novo, in 20% it is inherited from the mother, and in 10% it is inherited\n                               from the father. An sSMC can be causative for specific syndromes such as Emanuel, Pallister‑Killian, or cat\n                               eye syndromes. There may be more specific sSMC‑related syndromes, which may be identified by further\n                               investigation. These 10 syndromes can be useful for genetic counseling after further study.\n\n                               Key Words: Banding cytogenetic, fluorescence in situ hybridization, small supernumerary marker\n                               chromosome, syndromes\n\n      Address for correspondence:\n      Prof. Morteza Hashemzadeh‑Chaleshtori, Cellular and Molecular Research Center, Shahrekord University of Medical Sciences, Shahrekord, Iran.\n      E‑mail: mchalesh@yahoo.com\n      Received: 25.10.2014, Accepted: 24.11.2014\n\n\n\n      INTRODUCTION                                                                                      content of 46 chromosomes, are considered as an\n                                                                                                        extra chromosome or an sSMC, and are usually\n      A marker chromosome , abbreviated as mar by                                                       equal to or smaller in size than a chromosome\n      ISCN 2013, is a structurally abnormal chromosome.                                                 20 of the same metaphase spread.

While most children                           chromosomes that are either asymmetrical (type IIa)\n      do not independently ambulate, over 70% of the                             with one breakpoint located in each of the two\n      subjects eventually learn to walk with support.                            intervals, or symmetrical (type IIb) with both\n      Expressive language is significantly impaired, with                        breakpoints located in the distal interval.[29] Clinically,\n      rudimentary speech acquisition in only 20%.[21] The                        the features of CES include ocular colobomata, anal\n      most important differential diagnosis of ES is cat                         atresia, congenital heart defects, renal malformations,\n      eye syndrome (CES). CES generally derives from                             craniofacial anomalies (e.g., preauricular skin tags\n      partial tetrasomy 22.
