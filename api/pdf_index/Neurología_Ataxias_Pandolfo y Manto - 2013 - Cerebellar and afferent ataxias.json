A niece, the daughter of the patient’s younger brother, had\n                                       died at age 18 months of a multisystem disorder with severe cerebellar\n                                       atrophy, cardiomyopathy, and renal failure. This brother showed loss of\n                                       balance and clumsiness, accompanied by loss of visual acuity, at age 32, a\n                                       few years after the death of his daughter. Two years later, the patient’s\n                                       father developed gait instability at age 60, but his vision remained normal.\n                                       The patient’s first symptom was an alteration of color vision on the\n                                       yellow-blue axis, which became evident when she was 40 years old. At age\n                                       42, she could not tandem walk and had a very mild loss of visual acuity but\n                                       could continue working as a nurse. At age 43, her gait had become frankly\n                                       abnormal, some clumsiness of the hands had appeared, and her visual\n                                       acuity was 6/10 bilaterally with correction. The patient could not continue\n                                       working. At age 45, the combination of ataxia of gait and visual loss\n                                       prevented her from driving and even going out alone.
