Complex sSMC consist of chromosomal material derived from more than one chromosome; the\n  best known representative of this group is the derivative chromosome 22 {der(22)t(11;22)} or Emanuel syndrome. In\n  2008 we speculated that complex sSMC could be part of an underestimated entity.\n  Results: Here, the overall yet reported 412 complex sSMC are summarized. They constitute 8.4% of all yet in detail\n  characterized sSMC cases. The majority of the complex sSMC is contributed by patients suffering from Emanuel\n  syndrome (82%). Besides there are a der(22)t(8;22)(q24.1;q11.1) and a der(13)t(13;18)(q11;p11.21) or der(21)t(18;21)\n  (p11.21;q11.1) = der(13 or 21)t(13 or 21;18) syndrome. The latter two represent another 2.6% and 2.2% of the\n  complex sSMC-cases, respectively. The large majority of complex sSMC has a centric minute shape and derives from\n  an acrocentric chromosome. Nonetheless, complex sSMC can involve material from each chromosomal origin. Most\n  complex sSMC are inherited form a balanced translocation in one parent and are non-mosaic. Interestingly, there\n  are hot spots for the chromosomal breakpoints involved.\n  Conclusions: Complex sSMC need to be considered in diagnostics, especially in non-mosaic, centric minute shaped\n  sSMC. As yet three complex-sSMC-associated syndromes are identified. As recurrent breakpoints in the complex\n  sSMC were characterized, it is to be expected that more syndromes are identified in this subgroup of sSMC. Overall,\n  complex sSMC emphasize once more the importance of detailed cytogenetic analyses, especially in patients with\n  idiopathic mental retardation.\n  Keywords: Complex small supernumerary marker chromosomes (sSMC), Genotype-phenotype correlation,\n  Mosaicism, SSMC shape, Emanuel syndrome\n\n\nBackground                                                                               of the cases the sSMC is associated with clinical abnor-\nSmall supernumerary marker chromosomes (sSMC) are                                        malities [2].
