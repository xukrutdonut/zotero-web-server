There are two main time- and cost-intensive phases of the HR approach. First, the design and\n                                    cloning of the targeting vector, ESC transduction and selection, and generation of chimaeras. Second, the backcrossing of\n                                    mice to a desired background and/or cross-breeding to generate multiple genetically modified animals. By contrast,\n                                    cloning of short single-guide RNA (sgRNA) into a targeting vector, verification of sgRNA on‑target efficiency (through the\n                                    surveyor nuclease assay or sequencing), Cas9–sgRNA microinjection and founder identification are relatively easy and\n                                    fast120. Because embryos can be obtained from any mouse strain and multiple genes can be targeted simultaneously,\n                                    genetic backcrossing and cross-breeding are not required. c | Cas9 nucleases also enable precise in vivo genome editing\n                                    of specific cell types in the mammalian brain on a relatively short timescale.
